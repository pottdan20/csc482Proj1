I feel slightly bad saying intelligence is one of the major deciding factors in who I look up to, seeing as intelligence isn't really a character quality, but I think it still factors into my choosing of a favorite person, for good or for ill. Because I would really like to be effective at the things I do, and so I do tend to look up to those who are similarly competent.
