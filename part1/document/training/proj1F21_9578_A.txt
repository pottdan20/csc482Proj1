Wikipedia defines art as "a diverse range or product of human activity involving creative imagination to express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas". Art is something that all humans, despite our differences, come to admire in some way or another. An artist is an individual who creates these works for all to enjoy, whether it be through paint, sculpture, theater, laughter, music, or any creation of new material. Donald Glover, also known by his musical stage name, Childish Gambino, I believe he is the greatest pure artist and creative we will see in the 21st century.
Born in September of 1983 at Edwards Air Force base in California, Glover took to writing at a young age, and was voted "most likely to write for the Simpsons" in high school. He graduated from NYU with a degree in Dramatic Writing, and was hired to write for the NBC sitcom, 30 Rock, starring Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin. The show went  on to win 4 Emmy Awards and was a major success.  Glover left 30 Rock and went on to star in the NBC sitcom, Community, which did not have the same critical success as 30 Rock, but has garnered its own cult following none the less. Glover ended up leaving the show after 4 seasons despite being a fan favorite character, citing a need to work on projects that offered more independence.
in 2010 we finally got to see into the mind of an unchained Donald Glover. He released a 30 minute Comedy Central special and received the Rising Comedy Star award at the Just for Laughs festival in July 2010. He went on to release a full one hour comedy special in 2011 with Comedy central. 2011 also marked the first appearance of Childish Gambino, when glover released his first studio album, Camp. The album debuted at number eleven on the Billboard 200 and sold 52,000 copies in the first week. This mediocre success would be followed by Glover's meteoric rise to stardom.
Childish Gambino's second studio album, Because of the internet, debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 when it was released in late 2013. It featured several singles: 3005, Crawl, and sweatpants, with 3005 peaking at number eight on the UK R&B chart. This album would be certified Gold in 2014. He received a Grammy nomination for the album and a nomination for Best Rap Performance for 3005. in 2015 glover appeared in the films Magic Mike XXL and The Martian starring Matt Damon.  His greatest piece of work in my personal opinion is the 2016 TV series Atlanta, which glover directed and stars in. The show follows a Princeton dropout, Earnest "Earn" Marks, who manages his rapper cousin Paper Boy through the Atlanta rap scene. The series is very episodic and the over arching narrative takes a backseat to the cinematography, characters, and heavy themes that the show explores. Glover earned Golden Globes for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy and Best Actor - television series Musical or Comedy. He also won Emmy's for  Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, making him the first black person to win an Emmy for the latter category. 
Glover then went on to release "Awaken, My Love!" in 2016, and this was very unexpected as the album strayed from his rap roots and explored a more psychedelic experimental tone. He received 4 Grammy nominations and the single Redbone wound up winning the Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance. It should be objectively clear by his accolades alone that Donald Glover has explored almost every possible avenue of show business and succeeded at the highest level in all of them. The diversity in his work over a such a short time speaks to his true talent and creativity as an artist. I have enjoyed watching his career blossom and seeing him gain commercial success, more than that seeing him drift away from the traditional show business and create on his own terms is more than inspirational. For these reasons I believe that Donald Glover is the greatest artist I may ever see in my lifetime and the 21st century.
