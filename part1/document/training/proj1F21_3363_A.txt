My favorite person in the world has been by my side, or should I say that I’ve been by his side, since birth. This person is my dad, Sergio Ramirez. I chose my dad because he’s not only my father, but also my best friend and mentor. 
 
As a father, he has taught me how to take responsibility for my actions and how to be independent. Growing up, my father was very lenient with my brother and I when it came to hanging out with friends after school or on weekends. However, his policy was that whatever trouble we got into, we would have to suffer the repercussions and he would not attempt to bail us out of said trouble. Since he also worked long and late hours, my brother and I were in charge of making dinner for ourselves as well as handling all house chores. He taught us and gave me the skills necessary to be successful in the future.
 
As my friend, he has been my support pillar. His support has definitely allowed me to stay sane and mentally healthy especially through covid and other difficult times in my life. He makes sure to always call me once a week to check up on how I am doing, and I greatly appreciate him for that. He also always gives my advice or sends a few bucks here and there to help me get by.
 
As my mentor, he has taught me strong work ethics as well as wise decision making. My dad works in graphic design for the City of San Diego during the weekday and as a DJ on weekends. Seeing my dad work for hours on end, with his only resting day being Sunday, inspired me to work hard on all of my tasks whether they be work, school, or other activities. 
 
My dad has been and will always be the one person that I look up to and admire the most, and I would not be who I am or where I am today without my dad. He has taught me all of the skills I need to succeed in life, and I cannot be happier and luckier to call him my dad.
