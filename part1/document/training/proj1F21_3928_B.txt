My favorite vehicle is my WonderMobile! It's been in the family ever since I first started driving for my driver's permit. The first time I ever got behind the wheel was with my dad in an abandoned parking lot near the soccer fields. I remember struggling to park between the white lines; thankfully, driving has gotten easier since then. 
 
How did my WonderMobile get its name? Well, let me tell you... Back in high school I was really into superhero movies. When Wonder Woman came out, I went to see it several times in theaters because all my friends needed to see it! And I started driving right around then, so I combined Bat Mobile with Wonder Woman to form the awesome name, The WonderMobile. 
 
What car is it exactly? It's a 2014 hybrid Ford Fusion, and man does it have amazing gas mileage. I can drive halfway across California and it won't break my bank, but with these rising gas prices I don't know how long that will last. I don't know how all the gas guzzlers do it! 
 
My car has some pretty neat features too. It has smart cruise control which is a necessity for long drives. I can set a speed and my car practically drives itself. Not as fancy as Tesla's autopilot, but it will brake and maintain a preset distance, leaving me to man the steering wheel. Also, it has lights and sensors on the mirrors, and if someone is in my blind spot, the lights will flare up letting me know someone is there.
 
I love having a car and the freedom that comes with it. Especially living in San Luis Obispo, with the beach and mountains so close nearby, it has been a game-changer to finally have my car with me. I love being able to hop in and arrive at Pismo Beach in fifteen minutes, or make spontaneous trips to Trader Joes when I run out of food. Poor freshman trapped on campus with only their two feet to get around. I guess it's time for me to pay it forward and drive them around, just as upperclassman did for me back in the day.
