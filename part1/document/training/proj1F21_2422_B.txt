I think my car has to be the vehicle I write about. There is nothing special about it. It's not a particularly nice car, I don't plan on keeping it for the rest of my life, it has even been the source of a lot of frustration. But its mine. As I said, my car is nothing special. It's a four door, black sedan. It goes where I tell it to and nothing more. But it is a lot more than that. For me, my car is a source a freedom and joy and opportunity. Often times my car feels like home. 
While in college I have moved every single year. A few times I have moved multiple times in a single year. The one constant through all of this has been my car. It has always been there. There's a certain indescribable feeling I get every once in a while, when I drive my car. It would most accurately describe it as meditative. This sense of deep focus, contentment and peace overcomes me as I drive. It's just me, the road, the music, and my car. I don't know where this feeling comes from, but it is genuinely one of the best feelings I have ever felt. It can make hours feel like minutes and distract me from the greatest of my worries. 
Something interesting I find about my car is that when I am in it, I never think about wanting another car. When I'm not in my car I will often see cars on the road and think to myself how I may want said vehicle. It's easy to get caught up in how other cars look or perform and think they would be better than mine. Surely many cars would be better than mine, and eventually I will get a new car as mine will either break down or I will finally switch to an electric vehicle. But, when I'm in my car, I never feel the need for something else. My car does exactly what it's supposed to. It gets me from point a to b. 
Getting me from point a to b is all I can ask of a vehicle. The ability to travel is my favorite thing about my car. I have passed over tens of thousands of miles of road in my car. Each trip taking me to new and exciting places. My car has brought me to National Parks such as The Grand Canyon, Death Valley and Redwood; as well as cities such as San Diego and Portland. A deep desire in my life is to see as much of the world as I can. My car has been a great tool in achieving this goal and I've had many great adventures thanks to it. 
Overall, my car has been a great benefit to me and my life. It's weird to think of it as something I am attached to, but it is. In many ways my car has become a part of me. An ever-present entity in my life, it is always there when I need it and has yet to let me down. I look forward to many more journeys in my car and hope the day it breaks down never comes.
