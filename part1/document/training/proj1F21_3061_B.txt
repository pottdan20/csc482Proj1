My current vehicle is a 2001 Toyota Land Cruiser that I purchased in 2020. The paint is River Rock Green Mica, which is a gray green color that looks grey in some lights and green in others. I primarily use the car for surfing and camping.
A few days into owning the car, the transmission completely failed on the highway. Not a fun experience. I then spent a week swapping in a new, functioning transmission. That was a fun experience. Since then, I've driven over 20,000 miles without a single issue, despite the car now having 177,000 miles and being 20 years old.
One drawback to my Land Cruiser is the gas mileage. On a good day, I can average about 15 miles per gallon on the highway. However, this does not particularly bother me. I bike to work and school, leaving the Land Cruiser to be used for fun and hobbies. I can fit multiple large surfboards and a few friends without having to strap anything to the roof. I can also go off road and sleep in the car to camp. For these conveniences, I am willing to pay the price of driving a larger car.
I also enjoy working on the car. I typically do my own maintenance. I recently changed the oil in the engine and the front and rear differentials. I also built a platform for the back of the car. I also put bigger off road tires on the car.
I recently went on a trip to big sur. I put a few surfboards in my car and went surfing. I then drove up a mountain on some dirt roads and camped in my car.
