Old Betsy was a reliable Green Honda Accord that was passed down 3 generations in my family. The 1992 Honda Accord was reliable as they come, it went through much in the 22 years and rarely had any problem. Over the years the Honda Accord collected many cherished memories and served as a workhorse for our family.
 
The first owner was my grandfather who purchased the car in 1992, the same year my older sister was born. My grandfather absolutely loved the car and took great care of it. Growing up, he would taxi us from school to all our extra-curricular activities. What it did not have in speed or luxury, it had in panache. One seemingly normal day, my grandfather was driving us home,  and he accidentally stalled the car on a steep hill. As the car rolled down the hill backwards, it seemed that he forgot what a brake was. It took 10 seconds to start the car again and for him to get the car to stop. That was the last time I remember my grandfather driving that car.
 
The next owner was my aunt and father. As both of our families grew, Betsy remained the trustworthy car and lent help where it was needed. When my sister got her license, my father knew the perfect car to give her. It was quite fitting since it was bought the same year she was born, so they shared the same age. When my older brother also got to the driving age, my sister was quite enthusiastic to hand down the old car to him. Unlike my sister, my brother was quite elated to get this car. Though it didn’t have much power, he would still try to force it to drift around turns, something that it was definitely not intended to do. After both my siblings went off to college, the car was parked on our lot, waiting for me to become the next owner.
 
When I turned 16, I was ready to gain some independence, even if I had to drive a 22-year-old car. The car was sitting on our lot for a few years, so it had collected a bit of dust and rust over the years. However, I was ready to do whatever was necessary to get the car fixed up and drivable again. After only a few months of driving, the engine started to have some problems. One day when I was driving the car, the engine decided to overheat in the middle of the highway. It seemed that the car had finally had enough. So, we made the difficult decision to retire Betsy and give the car to some kid who was willing to spend the time to fix it up.     
Our Honda Accord survived us 3 generations and six different owners. Each owner was more than happy to have had the grace of using the car. However, after 22 years and more than 250,000 miles, the car finally gave out on us. As an integral part of our family’s life, we will always have cherished memories of old Betsy and its long and reliable life.
