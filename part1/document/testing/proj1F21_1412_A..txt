Jonathan Blow is my favorite person. Not only this, but he is my role model, and a person I want to embody in every sense of the term. He helped me to find my community, to work hard in the important aspects of my life, to seek intimate personal knowledge of myself, and to seek some truth deep down in my soul.
 
Jonathan Blow is the creator of the popular games The Witness and Braid. I have not played Braid, but have played nearly all of The Witness. In The Witness, you explore an island full of puzzles. Throughout the game, you find various clips of videos and audio logs, each of which contains some meaningful talk or quote. Every single one of the quotes put me on my ass and caused some serious self-examination. After playing through a lot of the game and having numerous experiences of this kind, I decided to check out the game's author. Jonathan Blow's home page on the internet is a basic html document with some links to various talks, some by Richard Feynman, some by other game developers. In exploring this site, I found a number of people who I relate to; I found my people. These were people who see the world with a sense of awe and wonder. People who were dedicated to scientific inquiry and to beauty all at once. I had never seen such spectacular people before, and it made me feel at home. The first thing about Jonathan Blow that I am thankful for is that he led me to a community.
 
The following weeks after I found Blow's community, I started listening to his talks at various conventions such as GDC and HandmadeCon. In them, Blow seemed to have an astonishing technical knowledge as well as a carefully curated design sense. He saw the problems with the basic tools of our industry, and believes with a non-cynical mind that they are solvable. Jon's method of learning is exceptionally simple, but it inspires me to learn in a whole new way. It goes like this: find a problem that you are curious about, then work towards a solution in the most basic way possible, learning what you need to along the way. This mentality is somewhat standard, but his insights on the details are remarkable. He taught me to simply start working at something, instead of waiting until you know that you have it right, and that spirit remains with me all the time. Thus, the second thing I am thankful to Jonathan Blow for is his lessons on the value of work.
 
After looking into his coding advice, I looked further, and found a number of videos that Blow has made concerning mindfulness. Blow is a practicing meditator and communicates his techniques in these videos. After trying a number of the techniques, I realized what wisdom I had been given! Blow's techniques have helped me deal with malaise, depression, and lots of other negative emotions. The technique works by recognizing that the emotions that we all feel so strongly are simple signals, signs that your body needs something. If you recognize this fact, then you can practice capturing those signals and isolating them, such that you don't need to feel them if you don't want to. I know, it sounds crazy, but it has worked spectacularly for me. Thus, I am also thankful to Jon Blow for his advice on meditation and mindfulness.
 
The final thing that I have learned from Blow is the most important. In his pursuit of making games, Blow has a fundamental drive to express something meaningful in his games. The way he talks about games makes them seem less like the complementary media that they currently are (combining story with some interaction) and more like a truly new form of art. Blow's games capture something indescribable about life, and through playing them, I have learned many things about the universe that are intimately close to my being, and that could never have been taught through any other medium. In this way, Jonathan Blow is a visionary, and makes me want nothing less to see that sort of vision in my own life. He inspires me to never relent in chasing that dream, and to believe in my own ability to express it.
