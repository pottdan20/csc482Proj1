Although somewhat rare in California, Subaru Outbacks are a popular and sought-after car in Oregon. The combination of its reliability, four wheel drive, and wagon-style utility make it an indispensable vehicle for the adventuring Oregonian to traverse snowy mountains paths, dusty deserts roads, and gravel terrain with ease. Its resale value is also very high, probably due to its great utility and durability.
My parents wanted to get me a used Outback, but it was difficult to find any good ones. Outbacks with moderate mileage tended to be bought within a week of being on the market, so we spent a few weeks just trying to find a good one. We finally found one up in Washington, so we drove several hours to see the car. We made the right choice; the car was in great condition and was even a premium model with extra features, like a backup camera and sunroof.
Although I am thankful for my car, the mileage is not very good, and the gas prices are very high in California. Additionally, since the Subaru is a wagon style vehicle, it is very long and difficult to maneuver in the narrower, urban streets of larger Californian cities. Parallel parking with the Outback is an especially Herculean task for a rural driver like myself. The Outback performs very well on the highway though, and I feel very safe while driving it.
My Outback can legally seat up to 5 people (including myself), and it has a very spacious trunk space that can be expanded by folding down the back seats. I was very happy with this function, since this meant that I could fit more stuff into my car when I was moving down. It has great traction, handling, and acceleration. The wheel is quite tight and difficult to turn for some reason though, and I think some people may dislike that part of the Outback.
The worst part about the Outback is probably the software and general technology that is part of the car. The screen inside the car, which can display information like the current song playing and backup camera footage, is terribly tiny - probably around the size of an iPhone 4 but slightly wider. Additionally, the settings menu does not have a back button to return to normal operation, so I have to reset the unit by restarting the car. Even though my Outback has frustrating characteristics newer models probably do not have, I am happy with the versatility and reliability of my vehicle.
