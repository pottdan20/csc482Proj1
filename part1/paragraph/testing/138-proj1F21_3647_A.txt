I graduated high school with the thought that I would never see him again, but by chance or necessity, we ended up hanging out constantly during the stay-home online college year. That period of time was a very enlightening one for me: one particular reason being that I had completely misjudged him. In fact, I could not have been further from the truth. The seemingly brash and reckless nature of his was coupled with a fervor to live life in the most genuine way possible, and his disregard for others' opinions lead him to never be fazed by the prospect of failure. He was not one for pretensions, even if it meant he would be inevitably misunderstood by many.
