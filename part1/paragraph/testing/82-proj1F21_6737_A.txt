My favorite person is laid-back and just very even-keeled. Not quick to hold a grudge, not quick to freak out, and not quick to push an agenda on other people. Somebody who is laid back is in large part someone you can enjoy quality time with. I also think that at least in this case it is indicative of having a strong sense of priorities.
