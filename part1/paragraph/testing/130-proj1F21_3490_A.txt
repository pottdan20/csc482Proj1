Miles Davis, who sadly passed away in 1991, exemplified the qualities of creativity and artistic integrity. He never backed down from a new challenge, and was always eager to push the boundaries of what was possible or expected as both a jazz musician, and as a Black man in the national spotlight. Though he could have stopped innovating at any time and ridden out the rest of his career playing his old hits, he remained defiant in the face of the pressures of fame and success. He is a shining beacon of what it means to be an artist.
