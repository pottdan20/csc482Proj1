I also admire the car model itself, it is a Toyota Sienna. Up until the catalytic converters stopped working the van had very few if any problems. It operated with only normal maintenance for around sixteen years of regular use. I cannot imagine designing a system that would operate under similar conditions to a car and be able to not break down for so long. I am sure that it did have its fair share of problems that I was not aware of, but it still feels like a magical contraption in my mind.
