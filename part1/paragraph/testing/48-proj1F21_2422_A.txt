When thinking of the individual to write about in this essay about one of my favorite people, several candidates came to mind. I count myself extremely lucky to have known the people I do and for the influence they have had on my life. In the end I decided to write about my oldest friend. Since I have not asked this person for permission to write about them, I will refer to them as Will.Â
