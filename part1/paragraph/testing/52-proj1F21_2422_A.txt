Thinking about the person I am today, it is very clear the aspects of myself that have been shaped by my relationship with Will. There are so many other things about him I wish I had the words for and so many other stories from his life that are private yet truly inspiring. Even though I may lose sight of it sometimes, I love the person I am today, and Will played a big role in helping me become that person. I often wonder if there are things about me Will admires or has been able to learn from. I hope so.Â
