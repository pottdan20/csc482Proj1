My Outback can legally seat up to 5 people (including myself), and it has a very spacious trunk space that can be expanded by folding down the back seats. I was very happy with this function, since this meant that I could fit more stuff into my car when I was moving down. It has great traction, handling, and acceleration. The wheel is quite tight and difficult to turn for some reason though, and I think some people may dislike that part of the Outback.
