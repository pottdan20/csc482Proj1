When I was a child, my family owned a red 1998 Ford Explorer. It was the first car my parents purchased after I was born, and was the primary means of shuttling my brother and I around as toddlers. For almost 90,000 miles over a decade, this SUV performed admirably; but, as with all cars, age finally got to it. After a series of unfortunate events, we decided it was time to upgrade, and sold our Ford “Exploder”.
