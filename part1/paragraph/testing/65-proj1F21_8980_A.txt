In college, Chloe participated in an international education program. She studied for one year in Nice, one year in Los Angeles, and one year in Singapore. Her year in Los Angeles was the first time in over a decade that we both lived in the same country - only three hours away from each other! We visited each other often throughout that year, and were able to celebrate each othersâ€™ birthdays together. It was amazing to see her so often during that year.
