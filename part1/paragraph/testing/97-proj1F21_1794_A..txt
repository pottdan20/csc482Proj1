At the time, a bombardier and his crew would fly 25 missions over enemy territory, dropping bombs, and returning to base over the English channel. After a crew completed 25 missions, they had served their time and were able to return home to America. When my grandfather's B-17 was shot down by German anti-air flak, his crew was the senior crew in the 8th air force, and only one crew had thus far completed their 25 missions. In 1943, my grandfather was shot out of the sky, and arrested in German territory, where he would serve as a prisoner of war (POW) for the remainder of World War II.
