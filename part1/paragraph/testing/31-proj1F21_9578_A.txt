Wikipedia defines art as "a diverse range or product of human activity involving creative imagination to express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas". Art is something that all humans, despite our differences, come to admire in some way or another. An artist is an individual who creates these works for all to enjoy, whether it be through paint, sculpture, theater, laughter, music, or any creation of new material. Donald Glover, also known by his musical stage name, Childish Gambino, I believe he is the greatest pure artist and creative we will see in the 21st century.
