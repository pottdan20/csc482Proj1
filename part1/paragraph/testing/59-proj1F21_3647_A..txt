Beyond all of this, what took me aback as we spent time together was the magnitude of his intellectual vitality. He would never be seen without some sort of non-fiction or helpful book, and we spent many hours into the night discussing and debating a wide variety of topics that ranged from the strange to the mundane. My conversational and reasoning skills improved significantly just by conversing with him, and spending time with him was a welcome break from the monotony of my regular entertainment routine of games, movies, and YouTube. As we continued to better each other throughout the year, for the first time in my life, I felt that I had made a true friend - someone I value as family. Knowing that the season of life was soon to change, we spent our summer days hiking, conversing, and playing a variety of board games.
