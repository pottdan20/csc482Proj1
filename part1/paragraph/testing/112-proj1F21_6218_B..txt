If you would drive a car and get a flat tire you would most probably have to buy a new tire to replace it which is expensive and might even have to get help to change it. With a bike, however, a new tire only costs a few bucks and it is easy to change by yourself. Often you will only need to replace the tube as well which is even less expensive. Overall, most fixes of a bike can be done by yourself; re-adjusting the chain, loosening or tightening the brakes, replacing the bell, etc. While in a car you would need to visit a car shop or have a lot of knowledge and tools to do many of the fixes. Even more so with newer cars where a lot of things are covered or hidden, for instance, it can even be hard to locate the battery poles of a new car when trying to jump-start it.
