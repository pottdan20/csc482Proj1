One of the biggest role models in my life was a man by the name of George Culver. Baseball is really important in my family. My brothers and I grew up playing the game. My dad always pushed us to be better, and he realized that baseball could take us to a lot of places if we became good enough. While I decided to take a different route, my two brothers went on to play for division one colleges, and my oldest brother even got to play in the minor league farm system for the Pittsburgh Pirates. While our dad pushed us, it was George who taught us the important complexities of the game and gave us each the opportunity to succeed.
