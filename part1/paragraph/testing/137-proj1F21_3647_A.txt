For one, he was absolutely atrocious at tennis - or at anything that required any sort of physical coordination for that matter. His left-handedness may have had a role in this, but he never seemed to improve at all. He missed forehands, threw bricks in basketball and even tossed a bowling ball into the other lane. His form in these sorts of sports was nonexistent, and he quickly became the butt of the jokes of the tennis team. Needless to say, he quit the team after two years. At that time, I perceived him as an uncoordinated, reckless individual and nothing more.
