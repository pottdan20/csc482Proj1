One of the vehicles my family owns is a 2021 Mazda CX-5. We bought this vehicle since our old car, a 2005 Lexus RX360 was had yet another engine failure due to our mechanic using low quality motor oil. Since that car was getting increasingly old and more expensive to repair, we decided to instead opt for a new car that was similar in size but with all the modern conveniences, including back up monitors and blind spot monitoring.
