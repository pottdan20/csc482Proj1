In order to describe the character of Ms. Lovelace, it is first necessary to provide some background on the work of fiction in which she resides. Now, as I am no great writer, nor even an adequate one, my synopsis cannot do the original justice, but in broad strokes Goldilocks is the story about a crew of astronauts aboard a colonization ship setting out with the task of preparing a new planet for habitation as the effects of climate change and pollution make Earth increasingly uninhabitable. As the crew struggles with system failures and other ethical concerns about what they are trying to accomplish, a number of stories from Naomi's past are revealed to provide a picture of her motivations and nature.
