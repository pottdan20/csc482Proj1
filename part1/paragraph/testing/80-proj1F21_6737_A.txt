My favorite person is honest, and genuinely concerned with authenticity. This is important to me because communicating where you are at is a pretty important part of connecting with other people, and shows a lot of trust. Honesty about oneself also begets a particular kind of humility, not self-deprecating but literally just being secure in the knowledge of what you are good at and what you are not, which I have a tremendous amount of respect for. Finally, I find it is a lot easier to listen to advice from an honest person.
