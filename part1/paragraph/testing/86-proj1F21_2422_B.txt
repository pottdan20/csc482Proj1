While in college I have moved every single year. A few times I have moved multiple times in a single year. The one constant through all of this has been my car. It has always been there. There's a certain indescribable feeling I get every once in a while, when I drive my car. It would most accurately describe it as meditative. This sense of deep focus, contentment and peace overcomes me as I drive. It's just me, the road, the music, and my car. I don't know where this feeling comes from, but it is genuinely one of the best feelings I have ever felt. It can make hours feel like minutes and distract me from the greatest of my worries.Â
