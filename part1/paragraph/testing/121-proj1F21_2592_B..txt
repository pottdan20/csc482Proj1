I recently lost my car because my parents thought it would be more beneficial for my sister to have it back home to drive herself to high school. I know a lot of people take the bus to and from Cal Poly every day, but let me tell you that I hate it. It always seems as though the buses come at weird times like way before my class or right after I'd need to leave to get to class on time. Right when I was ready to accept my bus-riding fate, my girlfriend broke her foot and now I'm using her car for the next few months!
