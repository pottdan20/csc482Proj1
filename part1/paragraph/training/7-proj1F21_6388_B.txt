Our Honda Accord survived us 3 generations and six different owners. Each owner was more than happy to have had the grace of using the car. However, after 22 years and more than 250,000 miles, the car finally gave out on us. As an integral part of our family’s life, we will always have cherished memories of old Betsy and its long and reliable life.
