We've grown up together. Quite literally, I have seen every step in life Will has taken and he has seen every step I have taken. Those steps have taken us down very different paths. We've both learned different things, discovered differing values, and made difficult choices. Though, in the big picture, our paths are more similar than they are different, we have become different people. Which is good. It has allowed us to learn from each other. There are so many aspects to who Will is that I admire so deeply. Will is good at everything he tries. Not just above average, not just surprisingly good at something he hasn't tried before, but genuinely, impressively good. Growing up Will tried a lot of different sports, from baseball, to soccer, to lacrosse, to hockey, and even competitive diving. In every sport he tried he excelled and quickly become one of the best on the team. This is not what impresses me. Well actually this does impress me greatly. One time we were playing soccer and trying to figure out if we could backflip in order to do a bicycle kick and he managed to backflip on his first try, but that is beside the point. The thing that impresses me most about Will is the way he approaches things. His mindset. Will is fearless in everything he does and thus commits fully to doing them. This extends beyond sports and into every aspect of his life. Will dropped out of college after one year because he realized it wasn't for him. Instead, he made his own path and is now very successful. When Will sets his minds to something he does it. He doesn't worry about what could go wrong or the possibility of failure. Though I am far from Will in terms of the degree of this mindset, his fearlessness is something I have learned a lot from and has really made an impact on my life. This and so many other things about Will differentiates us, and I have been able to learn from all of them.Â
