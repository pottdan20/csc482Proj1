The last thing I admire about the van is the level of human innovation that was required to get to this point. Thousands of years of technological progress and the work of millions of humans led up to the point of creations like this. Even now, hundreds of people probably work to assemble one car, whether they are assembling it directly or producing machines that will work for them. Even after that, the amount of time required to raise enough funds to buy a car is significant. A multi-thousand dollar purchase would require almost a year of work dedicated entirely to saving to purchase.
