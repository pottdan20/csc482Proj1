To put things bluntly, there has not yet been any particular vehicle in my life that I would consider interesting; vehicles, or at least the sort that one could reasonably own, are just another tool to get from one place to another. Just as one does not have a special fondness for a set of power drills or some other tool, so it goes with vehicles for me. Though, taking a moment to reflect on the validity of that prior statement, I wonder if the ideation of vehicles as tools in actuality explains anything at all: I know a number of people with special interest in their tools of trade, after all. Perhaps then, I only hold this position of indifference because I have never owned a car or a nice bike or anything of the sort, being cognizant of my inability to pilot such things with any degree of skill. Indeed, there are multiple vehicles that strike my fancy - high-speed public transit and spacefaring vessels in particular come to mind - just nothing I would consider mine. As such, I am struggling to pick any vehicle about which to write, but more pressingly I am having a difficult time mustering up relevant memories to form the foundation of this essay. I say all of this, in part to pad out the length of this text, but mostly to explain the vague nature and dry writing of what is to follow as I try and describe the minivan that my mother owned for most of my childhood, a Toyota Sienna of a year that I do not know.
