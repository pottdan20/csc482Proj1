The entire plane is built around a single cannon, the GAU 8/A. Manufactured by GE, this weapon is a massive 6 meters long and fires a bullet that measures 30 mm in diameter and is over 10 inches tall. It is also capable of firing at a blistering 3900 rounds per minute. This cannon is normally reserved for naval vessels and is capable of destroying any land based threat with relative ease. One of the major challenges the A10 designers faced, was compensating for the recoil produced by this weapon. When firing, the GAU 8/A generates 44.5kN of thrust, this effectively halves the total thrust of the aircraft, as each of the A10s engines only produce 41kN of thrust. It is a miracle in it of itself that the firing of this weapon does not tear the aircraft apart, let alone that this weapon can accurately hit targets from over 4 miles away during flight.
