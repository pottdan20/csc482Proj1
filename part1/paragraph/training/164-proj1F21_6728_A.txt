One of my favorite characters of all time is Zuko from the 2005 animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender. To set the scene of why he is my favorite character, we need to go on a deeper dive to the lore of the show. In the show, some people are born to control the power of an element(air, water, fire, earth), with only one person, the Avatar, able to control all four. The position of the Avatar is important since he is a physical representation of the balance among elements. Each generation, a new Avatar is born in one of the four element nations, with this generation's Avatar, Aang, being born in the Air Nomad nation. The setup for the story is that Aang, afraid of his responsibilities as the Avatar, decides to run away and disappears in a freak storm. At the same time, the fire nation, knowing that the Avatar, who can stop their plans at world domination, launches a genocidal war against the Air Nomads, wiping them out. However, they are unable to find the Avatar and instead decide to continue their crusade against other nations.
