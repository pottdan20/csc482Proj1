Glover then went on to release "Awaken, My Love!" in 2016, and this was very unexpected as the album strayed from his rap roots and explored a more psychedelic experimental tone. He received 4 Grammy nominations and the single Redbone wound up winning the Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance. It should be objectively clear by his accolades alone that Donald Glover has explored almost every possible avenue of show business and succeeded at the highest level in all of them. The diversity in his work over a such a short time speaks to his true talent and creativity as an artist. I have enjoyed watching his career blossom and seeing him gain commercial success, more than that seeing him drift away from the traditional show business and create on his own terms is more than inspirational. For these reasons I believe that Donald Glover is the greatest artist I may ever see in my lifetime and the 21st century.
