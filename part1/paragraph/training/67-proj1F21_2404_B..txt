From what I can remember, the Toyota in question was a white minivan with a faintly gold front and rear bumper, though grime, long exposure to the elements, and various nicks and dents heavily tarnished the exterior. In particular, there was a large dent, about the size of a small wok, on the front bumper that my dad wanted to get fixed at the shop but my mother never cared enough to actually follow through on. There was a roof rack mounted on top that never got any use because my father had opted to install it for purely aesthetic purposes, alongside a moonroof that I thought was supremely cool, but that was not allowed to play with after damaging the motor by constantly opening and closing it one time. The back right door was automatic but nonfunctional, and required a great deal of effort to open. As such, me and my brother exclusively used the left passenger door for ingress and egress.Â
