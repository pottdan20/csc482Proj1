Born in September of 1983 at Edwards Air Force base in California, Glover took to writing at a young age, and was voted "most likely to write for the Simpsons" in high school. He graduated from NYU with a degree in Dramatic Writing, and was hired to write for the NBC sitcom, 30 Rock, starring Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin. The show went  on to win 4 Emmy Awards and was a major success.  Glover left 30 Rock and went on to star in the NBC sitcom, Community, which did not have the same critical success as 30 Rock, but has garnered its own cult following none the less. Glover ended up leaving the show after 4 seasons despite being a fan favorite character, citing a need to work on projects that offered more independence.
