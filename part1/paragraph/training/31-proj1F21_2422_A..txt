At the time of our meeting, I don't think I needed Will and he most likely did not need me. After all, we were both kids, we had everything we could need provided for us and we were completely self-involved in the way kids are as they begin to discover the world around them. So why do I still believe that we meet people when we need them? Throughout my life there have been many times I have needed Will or he has needed me. Though in the moment we met we did not need each other, eventually we would. It would be easy to look at the theory of meeting people when you need them and dismiss it based on this example, saying simply, "Well if that is the case why didn't you and Will meet at a later point when you actually needed one another. This gets at something I find rather remarkable about my friendship with Will. I think, had we met at any other point we would not have become friends. We probably wouldn't have even liked each other. In many ways we are fundamentally different. The way we interact with and function in society is different. The things we value in life are different. We are such different individuals that when people who know us both find out that we are friends, and extremely close friends at that, they are shocked. Yet this is the very reason why I think Will and I are so close today.
