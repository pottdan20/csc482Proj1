When he returned from Germany, he went back to school at MIT, carrying on with his life. After interning at Oscar Mayer over the summer, he decided to change his major to Food Technology - a new major at the time. He would then go on to work for Oscar Mayer (a German company by the way), and work his way up the cooperate ladder to become the Vice President of Operations. This position afforded him the opportunity to live in Japan for a year while in talks with plant managers there about expanding Oscar Mayer's operations.
