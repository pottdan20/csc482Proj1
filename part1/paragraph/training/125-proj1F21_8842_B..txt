Creating one of these scooters costs as little as $30. All you really need to convert the old Lyft scooter itself to a personal one is a $30 control board that goes in a cavity at the top of the handlebars. This control board plugs into the same things that the GPS plugs into. To install the board all you need to do is to pull the screws off the GPS box at the top of the handlebars, remove the GPS holder, unplug the control board which also contains the GPS, and then plug in your new $30 control board. This control board is what controls the amount of power given to the motor based on the throttle. It also has a screen on top of it which provides you with a speedometer as well as controls to turn the headlights on/off. Now that you have a general idea of how easy it is to convert a GPS-tracked, smartphone-controlled Lyft scooter to a fully personal one, you may be wondering how you can get your hands on such a scooter. The best way to get a Lyft scooter is to find them at auctions, in storage units, or being sold by Lyft themselves. There are, however, other ways to obtain a Lyft scooter for free. That is for yourself to figure out though, I cannot tell you here for legal reasons.
