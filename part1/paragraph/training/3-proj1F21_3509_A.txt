Samâ€™s dedication to both his country and his job is apparent in everything he does as well. As seen in the earlier example, he spent an entire day crafting the perfect message for a birthday card, even forgoing a date he had planned. By far the biggest example has to be his stepping in to run for Congress in Orange County. He made a promise to Will Bailey to fill in if his deceased candidate won the primary, and followed through - even though he knew his loss could harm his career.
