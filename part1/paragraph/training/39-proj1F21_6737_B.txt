Right now I use it mainly to shop for groceries, sometimes to commute to campus, or to visit a church. Inside the car right now is some jumper cables and a first-aid kit in the back, some registration papers and a spare mask in the front, and one or two bags that I haven't bothered to unpack yet. The gas cap is on the driver's side, I think. The trunk is a regular hatchback that can fit a pretty decent amount if you drop down the seats (read: two tables, two chairs, and a lot of baggage).
