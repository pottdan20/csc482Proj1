Old Betsy was a reliable Green Honda Accord that was passed down 3 generations in my family. The 1992 Honda Accord was reliable as they come, it went through much in the 22 years and rarely had any problem. Over the years the Honda Accord collected many cherished memories and served as a workhorse for our family.
