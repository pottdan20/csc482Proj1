As opposed to other mathematicians, who would stray away from a problem if it took too long to solve, Nash could spend years concentrating on a problem until he is sure he has the solution. John Von Neumann was the complete opposite of Nash. Neumann is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians at the turn of the 20th century. In seconds, he could solve numerous famous mathematical problems in his head. His work in economics and creation of a new field, named game theory, was directly defied by Nash, who claimed there was multiple holes in the theory, all of which he could fix.
