One of the first times it broke down on us was on our way back to Washington at the end of a family trip to California. My mother was driving us up Highway 97 in Oregon near Klamath Falls, when she noticed the water temperature starting to rise at a concerning rate. Shortly thereafter, the power steering failed entirely. Seeing as we were traveling at roughly 70 mph, this was not ideal. She managed to coast our Ford into a parking lot for a city park right off the highway more gently than she had any right to. After having it towed to a mechanic, we discovered that part of the thermostat had disintegrated, jamming the water pump, and breaking the serpentine belt. All in all, a rather costly and unexpected detour.
