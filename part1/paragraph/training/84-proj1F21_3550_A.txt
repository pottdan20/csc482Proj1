One of my favorite people is undoubtedly Paul McCartney, rock bassist and singer-songwriter who originally rose to fame in the 1960s band, the Beatles. After the disbandment of the Beatles, he went on to have a successful solo career as well as form the band Wings, who were one of the most successful bands in the 1970s. Paul wrote many of the most famous Beatles songs, including "Let it Be," "Hey, Jude" and "Yesterday," the last of which is notably the most covered song of all time. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential songwriters, as well as one of the best rock bassists, of all time.
