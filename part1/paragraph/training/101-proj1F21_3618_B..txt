When looking at the market for a motorcycle there are many different options at varied price points and customer applications. Luckily, my cousin who is also an avid motorcyclist was able to guide me through the process of buying a motorcycle that's worth the money. I was able to snag up the Yamaha for around 3000 dollars a few years back which at the time was a relatively good deal.
