Have you ever wanted to get to school or go downtown without needing to drive your car? Have you also not wanted to ride a bike or walk in this situation? Well, look no further than an electric scooter. In my opinion, the best value electric scooter to own is a Lyft/Bird scooter converted to a personal scooter. Believe it or not, you can convert old Lyft and Bird scooters to normal personal scooters that donâ€™t require money or a GPS or money to use. This conversion is very easy to do, and only costs $30! I used to have one of these converted scooters, but unfortunately it is now out of my possession because someone was lending it to me. In this essay I will describe this scooter in greater detail, explain the joys of owning one, and explain how to convert a Lyft/Bird scooter to a personal scooter.
