My car is a red Honda Fit. It used to be a family car that my parents drove for years, but I was fortunate enough to take it down to San Luis Obispo when I started college. Having a car makes it very easy to be independent, as I can now drive to run errands, get to campus, and hang out with friends. One of the biggest attractions in San Luis Obispo is the beach, which is twenty minutes away from the Cal Poly campus. It would be extremely difficult to ever get to the beach without having a car.
