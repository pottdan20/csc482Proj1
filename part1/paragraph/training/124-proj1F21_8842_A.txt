    To summarize, three of the leadership traits Steve Jobs embodied that I want to embody as well were Decisiveness, Tact, and Endurance. Steve Jobs could make decisions on a whim, strategize to put himself in positions for success, and could focus and endure for great amounts of time. While Steve Jobs was not a great person, I hope that with enough effort and leadership experience, I can embody these traits as well.
