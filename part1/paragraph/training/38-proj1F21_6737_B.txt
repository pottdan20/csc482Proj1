Although it is new for me, it is not particularly a departure from cars I have driven before. Amusingly, this is the fourth Honda Fit that is owned in my extended family. Like my previous car, it is red and has a stickshift, which in my humble opinion are the two most important qualities in a car. My one gripe about it is that the leather on the steering wheel is starting to flake off, and I need to buy a steering wheel cover soon (also, the DMV virtual office for online title transfers is really not very good, but that isn't particularly the fault of the car).
