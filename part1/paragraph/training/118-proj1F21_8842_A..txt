    Steve Jobs was a very tactful CEO. In the 80s, Jobs was ousted from his role as Apple’s CEO, and for a while didn’t know what he would do. He eventually started a new computer company named NeXT, and also helped start Pixar, which would go on to create Toy Story under his leadership. Jobs was very tactful at Pixar, as the company actually started when Jobs bought Lucasfilm’s computer graphics division because Jobs saw the intersection of the arts and computing as the future. Jobs bought Lucasfilm’s graphics division for $5 million, Toy Story had a box office of $373 million. Jobs was even more tactful with NeXT, as he designed his software to work on Apple computers, and when Apple was looking for a company to help them build their own software after some struggles, they ended up buying NeXT. This eventually put Jobs back into his role as Apple’s CEO leading to Apple’s great success with the iPod and iPhone. Not only was Jobs tactful, he also showed a great deal of endurance.
