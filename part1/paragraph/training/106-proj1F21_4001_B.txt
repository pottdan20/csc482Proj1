I’ve been in many vehicles over the course of my life, from planes to boats to cars and busses, but my favorite vehicle by far is my road bicycle. My freshman year in college I joined the Triathlon Team here at Cal Poly and arrived at my first bike practice on my father’s old Novara Element. While the Element was a solid and dependable bike, by the time I was using it, it was clearly showing its years. I rode it and several other bikes, but by the end of the year, it was clear I needed a new bike of my own. After significant consideration, I chose to purchase a black and blue Canyon Aeroad CF SL. Since then, I’ve ridden the bike over three thousand miles and its beauty, utility and sentimental value have made it my favorite vehicle of all time.
