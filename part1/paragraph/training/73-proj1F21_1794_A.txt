One of my favorite people is my grandfather, whose name I carry on as my middle name. He recently turned 98, yet continues to live in good health. He is one of my favorite people because of the work ethic he has exhibited throughout his life, the wisdom he has gained, the compassion and patience he has for other people, and his devotion for learning.
