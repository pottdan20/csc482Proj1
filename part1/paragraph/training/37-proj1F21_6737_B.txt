It is new for me, but not particularly new in general. I purchased it right before moving up to San Luis Obispo, because while my previous car was still running well it was getting old enough that I would not necessarily want to count on it for long drives between San Luis Obispo and home. I bought it from my mom's college roommate's neighbor, who was apparently having a hard time selling a care that had stickshift. I am glad I got the car because the new car has gone roughly 50 thousand miles less than my previous car, and selling the previous car covered a little over half the cost of the new one.
