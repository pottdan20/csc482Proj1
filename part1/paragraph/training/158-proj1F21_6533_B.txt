My favorite vehicle of all time is the Boeing 787, sometimes referred to as the Dreamliner. This is one of the most advanced civilian aircraft, and contains revolutionary technology for maximizing comfort and safety. Three features of the 787 which set it apart from other aircraft are the carbon fiber frame, the advanced air filtration and conditioning system, and the smart electronics. I greatly prefer flying on a 787 over any other aircraft, though I have only had the opportunity to do so a few times in my life.
