Davis began his career in the midst of a revolution in jazz. Lead by Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and others, Bebop was a reaction against the forms of jazz that came before it. Popular jazz of the time had drifted away from its roots as an African-American folk music, and instead was typically played by large ensembles, sometimes with orchestral accompaniment, and was designed to be easily danceable. Beboppers wanted to further explore the creative (as opposed to popular) possibilities of jazz music, and did so by stripping it back to its very basics: a drummer, a bassist, a pianist, and a horn player (saxophone or trumpet being the most common). They played with complicated chords, convoluted melodies, and at breakneck speeds. Although Davis came up playing in this style, and was more than comfortable with it, he quickly tired of it, and desired an approach that permitted more beauty and feeling. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he pioneered just that, a new jazz that was the “cool” to Bebop’s “hot,” aptly named Cool Jazz. Although it was also focused on individual musical expression and built around the same combination of players, it created a new mode of expression with jazz music that emphasized deliberate, refined, and richly textured playing, which would not-so-coincidentally continue to be hallmarks of Davis’s playing throughout his career.
