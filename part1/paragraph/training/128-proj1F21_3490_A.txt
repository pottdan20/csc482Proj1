Into the 50s and 60s, Davis continued to push boundaries. His main innovations in this period seemed to be in the pursuit of simplicity and abstraction. With his “First Great Quintet,” which featured among others the soon-to-be legend John Coltrane, he developed Modal Jazz, which simplified the song framework by spending up to minutes at a time on just one chord. It was with this quintet that he released the seminal Kind of Blue album, the best selling jazz record of all time. Yet still he was not satisfied; when he grew restless with this ultra-Cool approach, he again shifted, solidifying around an entirely new and much younger band including a 17-year-old drummer. With this group, dubbed his “Second Great Quintet,” he pioneered Post-Bop, a loose style that nearly eschewed chord changes and timing altogether.
