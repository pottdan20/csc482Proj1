The second major failure that I remember happened at Lassen National Park. After a full day of hiking, my brother, my mom, my grandparents and I were all prepared to drive back to the lodge for a hot meal and a good nightâ€™s rest. Unfortunately, the Exploder had other plans. Upon attempting to start it and shift it into drive, my mom discovered it was stuck in 4WD low. It took nearly 20 minutes of doing laps around the parking lot, shifting in and out of drive, before it dislodged. That issue turned out to be an issue with the transfer case, costing almost $3,000.
