Just because the metro is such a beautiful and efficient system does not mean it is right for everywhere. The United States is the most car-dependent nation on Earth, and will likely remain so as the rest of the world adopts or adapts to the emerging possibilities of public transportation. Because of the way our cities have been designed, it would be very difficult to integrate an effective public transportation system into our sprawling urban landscapes, even if the auto lobby did not aggressively lobby against them. It is made even more difficult because of Americanâ€™s laisse-faire culture, which values individual freedom of movement over the inherently social nature and community control of public transit. Still, I hope that my dream of effective public transit in America can be more than just a dream.
