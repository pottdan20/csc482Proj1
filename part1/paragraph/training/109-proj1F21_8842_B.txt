Riding an electric scooter to run a quick errand when you can’t be bothered to take a different vehicle is one of the most convenient things in the world. Sometimes you are too tired to ride your bike a couple miles, but a couple miles is also too short of a distance to drive your car and find parking. The electric scooter comes in perfectly in this situation, as you can essentially float to your destination. You don’t have to move your legs, and you also don’t have to waste time looking for parking. It’s like teleportation except not instantaneous. Not only is the scooter convenient, but it is also a blast to ride. The electric motor is snappy and accelerates you quickly (but not so quickly it is uncomfortable). The thick tires provide a comfy ride and can also handle some mild off-roading which is sometimes necessary in San Luis Obispo. The 20 mile per hour top speed leaves you with your hair blowing in the wind feeling like you are in a movie. Not only is it a blast to ride, but it is also a great conversation starter. When you pull up on a Lyft scooter in San Luis Obispo, people get interested and start asking questions. When you tell them that it was a Lyft scooter converted to be a personal scooter, they get even more interested. The scooter itself is almost like a party trick and is fun to bring to events and let people test ride. Now that you know how much of a blast it is to own one of these scooters, you might be wondering how you can get one for yourself.
