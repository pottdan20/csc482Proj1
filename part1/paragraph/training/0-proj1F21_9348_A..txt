One of my favorite people is Rand al'Thor, the main character of the book series The Wheel of Time. The Wheel of Time is a really long book series that details the journey of Rand and his friends as they try to unite a world that is falling apart so that they can stand against the ultimate evil yet to come. Rand is not always the focus of the series, but he is the most important character, being the chosen hero that is destined to save the world.
