One of my favorite people is Lucas, one of the other students in the Math graduate program with me. Lucas is a man of many talents: beyond his ability to do math, he is also a philosopher, comedian, and artist. Though I only met Lucas 18 days ago, I already feel as if I have known him for a lifetime. His radiant personality unites us math students against an otherwise irreconcilable torrent of complexity, obscurity, and abstraction.
