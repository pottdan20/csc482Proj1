In high school, I drove a 1995 Lexus LS 400. That car was obviously very old at the time that I used it, and it had well over 200,000 miles on it. What is even more surprising is that the car remains in my family today, and it is running well. The Lexus also has some sentimental value to my family. It was one of the first cars that my parents ever bought. Having been in the family for well over 20 years, I find this car quite interesting.
