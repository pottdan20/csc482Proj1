My favorite vehicle is the 1984 Chevrolet El Camino. While it's not the most modern vehicle, the El Camino has a classic charm and personal connection that make it important to me. A unique car pickup truck hybrid, its a beautiful vehicle that sets itself apart from the cookie-cutter car models that clog most modern roads. Since they were discontinued in the late 1980's, its even more rare and exciting to see an El Camino still running today.Â
