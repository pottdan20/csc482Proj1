My favorite person is my best friend Chloe. We met in kindergarten at five years old and immediately became great friends. Chloe and I would organize playdates every day after school, and eventually our parents met. Both of our sets of parents had immigrated from France, so they could relate to each other's experiences and cultures and eventually became close friends. Chloe's brother is the same age as mine, so they ended up becoming close as well. Chloe's family lived just two blocks away from mine so we would walk to school together every morning; our families spent a lot of time together for a couple of years.
