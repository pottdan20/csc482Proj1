Although I am thankful for my car, the mileage is not very good, and the gas prices are very high in California. Additionally, since the Subaru is a wagon style vehicle, it is very long and difficult to maneuver in the narrower, urban streets of larger Californian cities. Parallel parking with the Outback is an especially Herculean task for a rural driver like myself. The Outback performs very well on the highway though, and I feel very safe while driving it.
