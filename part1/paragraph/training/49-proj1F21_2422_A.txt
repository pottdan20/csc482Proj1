I met Will in preschool. I do not remember meeting Will. Nor do I remember why I befriended him or perhaps he befriended me. I often think about this fact. As a little kid, why did I gravitate to him and him to me? Perhaps there was something about each other that we could perceive yet not understand. Perhaps there was a sense we could connect with each other on that truly deep level that is so rare. Or was he simply the first person I said hi to. Another extremely important person in my life who deserves an essay of their own said this to me when discussing why we befriend the people we do. They said, "We meet people when we need them." I tend to believe this.Â
