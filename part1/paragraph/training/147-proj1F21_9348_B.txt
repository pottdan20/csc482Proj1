We first got the minivan in 2004 when I was four years old. This was the same year that my sister was born. Since then it has been in almost continuous use up until the beginning of this year when the catalytic converters finally gave out and it cannot pass the smog check. To replace the converters on this particular car would cost almost as much as the car is worth itself, so repairing it is out of the question. This means that the car is pretty much dead at this point and the last journey it will make is to the junkyard.
