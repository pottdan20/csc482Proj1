All those traits would later become the building blocks of Nash’s personality and his defensive nature. Those qualities in the 1950s would also influence how Nash would later tackle well-known difficult problems with little outside help. In the 1940s and 1950s, there were an abundance of problems and unproven conjectures for any bright and ambitious mathematician to tackle such as Nash. Admittedly, his own inability to admit defeat and his arrogance would later come back and haunt him as well. His arrogant nature is most prominent when he refused to marry Eleanor, the women who was bearing his child, due to him deeming her as someone that was not worthy or unequal to him. Any account of Nash’s intent whether or not to marry Eleanor was never confirmed to be true. A likely reason was his obsession with class, similar to his father’s, where he believed that Eleanor’s social inferiority would have been difficult for her to mingle with other wives of the Cambridge mathematical community. When their son, John David Stier, was born, Eleanor had to give him up to foster care, which drove her mad. Her son’s leave made her believe that Nash “left all the anguish and the worry to her and gave no sign that he understood, even remotely, what such a separation might mean for a mother or her child”. Of course this was what made Nash’s life most despicable, his nonexistent capacity for empathy. Nash would end up losing multiple relationships, friendships, and make numerous enemies in his lifetime.
