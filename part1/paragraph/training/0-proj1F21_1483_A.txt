For the purposes of this essay, my favorite person is David Lynch. I say this not as someone who is an austere purveyor of "art film," which I barely engage in, but as an individual concerned with maximizing their experience of beauty throughout life. His productions are masterpieces, and I truly mean productions in an all-encompassing sense, from his great feature films to shorts to his enigmatic announcements. Seriously, this dude can direct serious movies which steal your dreams and then go home and do it again in a semi shitpost despite being over 70 years old.
