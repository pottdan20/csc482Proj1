In attempting to start this assignment where I must write about a figure, fictional or otherwise, of which I am particularly fond of, I am confronted with a distinct lack of substance to draw from. This is not due to a personal dearth of social experiences, though there is some or perhaps a great deal of veracity in that claim, but rather that if I am to write about the aforementioned peoples of which I respect and admire, I must necessarily disclose information that I would rather not have others become privy to. Besides, to describe in detail the character and qualities of another person for the not-all-too-altruistic goal of achieving a satisfactory grade, even in admiration and using most respectable language, would nonetheless be a strange undertaking - at least in my opinion. All of that is to say, in a most long-winded and verbose manner indicative of style of writing that is to come, that I am opting to write about a fictional character still fresh in my mind on account of having just finished the book: one Naomi Lovelace from Goldilocks, by Laura Lam.
