I drive a white 2019 Honda Accord Sport. My dad bought me this car in August of 2019.Â  My car has 192 horsepower with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. It also averages up to 29 and 35 miles per gallon on the city and highway, respectively. The Honda Accord is a four-door sedan that can fit up to five people. It also has beautiful leather-trimmed seats which provide a lot of seating comfort.
