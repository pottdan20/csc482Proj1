The Marin was a mountain bike with 29" tires, but I never took it on the mountains. When I bought the bike, the salesman said "Are you planning to mountain bike? Because if not I would suggest getting a hybrid instead." Well, I ignored that entirely and got it anyways. It had some power behind it, and I always preferred the momentum and wider tires of mountain bikes, even if I did mostly keep it on the asphalt. I biked around 600 miles that first year, and didn't find myself needing to repair it. The one time I changed the tires that whole time was for an English project, where I made a video tutorial for changing a bike tire.
