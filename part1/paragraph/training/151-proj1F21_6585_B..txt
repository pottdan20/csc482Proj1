The Miyata Seventen is just one of the many bicycles made by the legendary Japanese bike manufacturer, Miyata. While they are still around, Miyata no longer sells their bikes outside of Japan. Similar to other bike manufacturers, they use a numbering system that differentiate between every model. In the case of the seventen, it's a part of the 7xx series, which is used for mid-end road bikes.
