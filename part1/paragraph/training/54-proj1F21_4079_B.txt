Speed. Safety. Convenience. They have it all. Electric skateboards are a recent innovation that has changed traveling for the better. Equipped with regenerative braking, speed controls and improved maneuverability, electric skateboards can do just as much as, if not more than, a bicycle. This makes my electric skateboard, a Boosted Board Mini X, my favorite means of transportation over short distances. The Mini X is a short form electric skateboard that is a refreshing change from Boosted's line of other products. It features a maximum range of about 14 miles which is plenty for my daily commute to and from school. A top speed of 20 mph and a hill climb gradient of approximately 20-25% makes navigating the hilly terrain of San Luis Obispo extremely easy and fun. The board also features regenerative braking to ensure powerful stopping capabilities without sacrificing a lot of battery.
