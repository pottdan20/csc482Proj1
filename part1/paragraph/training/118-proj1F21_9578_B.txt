Despite the land conflicts of the Cold War never becoming a reality, the A10 has still seen use all across the world almost every conflict the US has had since the 70s. Infantry are the first to sing its praise and, many servicemen will talk about how just the sound of the GAU 8/A was enough to raise their spirits in heated combat. However, there are many detractors of the A10, and they argue that this plane does not serve a purpose now that other aircraft like the F16 are capable of carrying similar armaments (except the GAU 8/A). What they don't recognize is that loading up the F16 in this manner removes all of its agility, its biggest advantage in the field. Most of these detractors are not in the field or serving, and people who are directly affected by this aircraft say that there is no replacement for a purpose built machine doing what it was made for.
