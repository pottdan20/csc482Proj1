My parents wanted to get me a used Outback, but it was difficult to find any good ones. Outbacks with moderate mileage tended to be bought within a week of being on the market, so we spent a few weeks just trying to find a good one. We finally found one up in Washington, so we drove several hours to see the car. We made the right choice; the car was in great condition and was even a premium model with extra features, like a backup camera and sunroof.
