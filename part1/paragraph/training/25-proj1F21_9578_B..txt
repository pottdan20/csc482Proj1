The A10 was designed to be used for close air support, which requires it to have massive firepower but also the durability to take fire from the enemy without bringing down the aircraft. Practically every component on the A10 can be replaced if damaged unlike many other jet aircraft. The A10 is actually notorious for limping home from battle almost unrecognizable, with damage that would have totaled most aircraft. The A10 also is packed with redundancies to account for components that are destroyed in battle. the twin engines and twin hydraulic systems are the best example of this. Both the GAU cannon and flight surfaces (ailerons, rudder, etc.) are powered and controlled via twin hydraulic systems in the aircraft. In the event that one of these systems is destroyed, the aircraft is designed to be ran off just a single hydraulic system and seal off the leak from the inoperable system. In the event that an entire engine is destroyed, the A10 is capable of flight, albeit without the use of its main cannon.
