Overall, my car has been a great benefit to me and my life. It's weird to think of it as something I am attached to, but it is. In many ways my car has become a part of me. An ever-present entity in my life, it is always there when I need it and has yet to let me down. I look forward to many more journeys in my car and hope the day it breaks down never comes.Â
