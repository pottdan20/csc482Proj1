To this day, when I visit my grandfather, he has book recommendations prepared for me, and he listens earnestly while I explain to him how desktop shortcuts work. He writes down everything he wants to remember, and he keeps things very organized on his desk for easy access. I admire his commitment to learning and keeping his mind healthy and active. He is a generous and caring individual, and a puts a smile on my face every time I see him. Despite the hardships he endured in his life, he has worked hard and made something great out of himself. I can always count on him for wisdom, advice, or a great story.
