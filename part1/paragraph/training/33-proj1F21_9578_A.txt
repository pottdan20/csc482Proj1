in 2010 we finally got to see into the mind of an unchained Donald Glover. He released a 30 minute Comedy Central special and received the Rising Comedy Star award at the Just for Laughs festival in July 2010. He went on to release a full one hour comedy special in 2011 with Comedy central. 2011 also marked the first appearance of Childish Gambino, when glover released his first studio album, Camp. The album debuted at number eleven on the Billboard 200 and sold 52,000 copies in the first week. This mediocre success would be followed by Glover's meteoric rise to stardom.
