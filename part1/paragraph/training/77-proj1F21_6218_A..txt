Imagine a person who is unselfish and only thinks about others. Who is willing to give people things of monetary value without expecting anything in return. Imagine that this person's one goal is to once a year give everyone around the world some joy in their life, while also working on improving the manners of kids. Wouldn't this person be considered the best person ever? Well, that person exists and his name is Santa Clause.
