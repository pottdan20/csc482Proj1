Although I have only ridden it a few times in my life, my favorite form of transportation is the metro, though it is known by many names. It is the system of under- and above-ground trains found in many large cities, especially in the Eastern U.S. and Europe. Although most probably donâ€™t find riding them especially interesting, I personally find it thrilling.
