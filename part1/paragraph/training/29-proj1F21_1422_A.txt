One of my favorite people is my best friend Arya. She's one of those people that everybody gets along with. She's incredibly kind and patient with people. Her house was where we threw all the parties since her parents were very laidback. If I think back about high school, most of my best memories were at her house. We were the dynamic duo planners of our group. She was the eternal pacifist and is very welcoming. She'll always invite new people to hangouts and introduce to everybody and make sure they feel welcome.Â
