To get more specific about what this “converted Lyft/Bird scooter” actually is, it is a Lyft/Bird scooter repurposed to be used as a personal scooter. This means there is no GPS in the scooter, and it operates solely with an on-button, brake, and throttle. There is no need to connect with a smartphone, you can just turn it on using the button and then it just goes. The scooter is a Segway brand scooter and is actually quite high quality. The actual consumer model sold by Segway is worth $600 and can go up to 20 miles per hour. The laws around electric scooters state that you shall not ride a scooter faster than 15 miles per hour, so the speed of this scooter is quite a treat and quite useful at times. The scooter’s brake is powerful and can slow you down in a pinch. The frame of the scooter is very wide, and the bars sit quite tall, so it puts you in a good upright position while you ride it. The scooters tires are wide and provide ample grip and damping for everyday riding. The scooter also comes with a headlight and taillight, so it is safe to ride at night and is within the law. All in all, this scooter comes with everything you could possibly need. Now that you know what these scooters actually are, you may be wondering how nice it is to own one.
