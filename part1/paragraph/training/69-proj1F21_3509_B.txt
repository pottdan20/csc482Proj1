The final straw was also at a national park, this time at Mount Rainier. After another long day of hiking, we arrived at the doors of our trusty Ford, only to find out that it would not start. Being 5,400 feet up did not help matters either. We had to have it towed down the mountain to the little town of Morton, which was only just large enough to have a dealership. From there, we had to have my grandmother bring my momâ€™s brand new CR-V all the way from home.
