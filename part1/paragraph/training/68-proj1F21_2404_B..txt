The interior could seat up to seven people, counting the driver, with two dull brown nylon seats in the middle row and a large seat in the back that could fit three. As soon as we were allowed to, as in when we no longer needed booster seats, my brother and I elected to always sit in the back row because of the presence of side compartments that we would store our toys and other knickknacks in. If the outside was to be considered dirty, the interior was at least an order of magnitude worse, with fabric stains, food scraps, and other bits of trash littering that back section claimed by two young boys - I'll spare you the particularly gross details. The air conditioning flow in the rear of the car was quite weak and distinctly warm, though I suppose that is true of many car air conditioning systems. Beyond that I cannot recall much of anything else.
