Bikes can be dangerous though if not treated with respect by the bicyclist or other people. Many bicyclists die each year due to single or multiple vehicle incidents where they might just fall of the bike or hit/get hit by another vehicle such as a car. One common safety measure is to wear a helmet whenever you ride a bike, but that is not always going to save your life if you are for instance hit or run over by a car at high speeds. Many car drivers are unaware of bicycle lanes when crossing them and can easily miss that there is a bike on them. It is important to acknowledge that bikers exist and that they can be just beside or behind your car even though they can be hard to spot in mirrors.Â
