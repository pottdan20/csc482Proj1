As brilliant as Nash was, his social IQ was still very much lacking. One of the biggest mistakes he made was not only that he refused to marry Eleanor, but that he began to date another woman after he left her. That decision would later come back and haunt him when his father calls and tells him of his knowledge of Nash’s son. Eleanor has gotten a lawyer and demanded child support payments, but Nash still “was inclined to refuse to pay”. His decision shows who he really is as a person, which is a man who won’t do the right thing because he believes it to not be worth his time.
