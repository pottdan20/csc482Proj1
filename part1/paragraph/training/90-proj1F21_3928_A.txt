One of my favorite people is my best friend Kira. We met during WOW our freshman year and have only grown closer as the years passed by. Our first real hangout was hiking the P together. I had been wanting to go but none of my roommates liked hiking, and I ran into her doing laundry and convinced her to come with me. Her spontaneity and sense of adventure are one of my favorite qualities about her.
