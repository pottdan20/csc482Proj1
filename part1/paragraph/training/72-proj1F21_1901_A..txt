Stephen Hawking was a theoretical physicist who was famous for his study of black holes. In the 1970â€™s Hawking theorized that black holes should emit radiation, causing them to eventually vanish. This was a significant idea because it had previously been thought that black holes would persist. What was even more impressive about Hawking was that he was able to make these scientific breakthroughs despite having been diagnosed with ALS early in his adulthood. As a result, Hawking remains one of my favorite people as he serves as a paragon of resilience and maintaining a sense of humor despite hardship.
