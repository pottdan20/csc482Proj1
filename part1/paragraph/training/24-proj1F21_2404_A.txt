Speaking about Ms. Lovelace, she herself is the protagonist and primary speaker for much, though not all, of the novel. Born as the daughter of a famous roboticist, Naomi was orphaned at a young age due to a house fire accident. After being bounced around a number of caretakers, she was ultimately taken in by Valerie Black, the wealthy entrepreneur and businesswoman who worked closely with Naomi's mother. Under Black, Naomi grew up amidst wealth and privilege, being given the means to pursue her dream of working at NASA and becoming an astronaut; eventually, after a number of rejections and setbacks, she succeeded, becoming a leading expert in space botany and hydroponics.Â
