As a computer science major, I have great respect for Alan Turing, the "Father of Modern Computing." He is well known for his groundbreaking work establishing the foundations of computer science years before the first computer was ever created. Most of my computer science classes reference Alan Turing in some way, so I decided to take this opportunity to research his history. I found that Turing made massive breakthroughs in the fields of cryptology and artificial intelligence and aided in the Allies effort in World War II, however his life was cut short due to the homophobic laws of the time.
