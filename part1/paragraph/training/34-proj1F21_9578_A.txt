Childish Gambino's second studio album, Because of the internet, debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 when it was released in late 2013. It featured several singles: 3005, Crawl, and sweatpants, with 3005 peaking at number eight on the UK R&B chart. This album would be certified Gold in 2014. He received a Grammy nomination for the album and a nomination for Best Rap Performance for 3005. in 2015 glover appeared in the films Magic Mike XXL and The Martian starring Matt Damon.  His greatest piece of work in my personal opinion is the 2016 TV series Atlanta, which glover directed and stars in. The show follows a Princeton dropout, Earnest "Earn" Marks, who manages his rapper cousin Paper Boy through the Atlanta rap scene. The series is very episodic and the over arching narrative takes a backseat to the cinematography, characters, and heavy themes that the show explores. Glover earned Golden Globes for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy and Best Actor - television series Musical or Comedy. He also won Emmy's for  Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, making him the first black person to win an Emmy for the latter category.
