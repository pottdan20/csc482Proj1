In Paris, the metro system can efficiently get you anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes. When one really thinks about how efficiently, effectively, and safely this metro system transports literally millions of people each day, it is astounding. And itâ€™s not just about aggregate safety and efficiency; an hour spent commuting on a Los Angeles free-way is an hour you must spend at peak alertness, to avoid a car crash that will at the very least ruin your day, if not your life. An hour spent on the metro is an hour you can be working offline, reading a book, or just resting. It is just a more pleasant time all around.
