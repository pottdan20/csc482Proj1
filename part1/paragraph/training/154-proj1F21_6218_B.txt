An argument against bikes is that it can get hard to bike, especially long distances or uphill. If you are not a fan of the workout, you can always invest in an electric bike instead which will help you a lot. Although as mentioned, it is a workout which is another great thing about bicycles - you can use them as a workout tool and a transportation tool at the same time. Say that you have a 20-minute bicycle distance from your home to the workplace. You can then get 40 minutes of "free" workout time per day while commuting, and will probably be able to improve that over time. The other options might be to go by car/public transport which does not include the workout but might take less time to get from a to b, but at the same time, you must look around for a parking spot or wait for the public transport to arrive.
