A few days into owning the car, the transmission completely failed on the highway. Not a fun experience. I then spent a week swapping in a new, functioning transmission. That was a fun experience. Since then, I've driven over 20,000 miles without a single issue, despite the car now having 177,000 miles and being 20 years old.
