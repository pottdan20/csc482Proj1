The worst part about the Outback is probably the software and general technology that is part of the car. The screen inside the car, which can display information like the current song playing and backup camera footage, is terribly tiny - probably around the size of an iPhone 4 but slightly wider. Additionally, the settings menu does not have a back button to return to normal operation, so I have to reset the unit by restarting the car. Even though my Outback has frustrating characteristics newer models probably do not have, I am happy with the versatility and reliability of my vehicle.
