One of the people in my life that I admire most is my grandfather, David Klein. I’ve had the privilege of knowing all four of my grandparents, and while I love them all I’ve gotten to know and admire my father’s father, David the most. He grew up in The Bronx, with three siblings and an Eastern European Jewish father, and a Protestant Christian mother. He and attended Columbia for his undergraduate degree and Berkely for a Master’s. There he was part of the anti-Vietnam war movement and became an overall hippy. He eventually ended up in Boston where he met my grandmother, and my father and aunt when they were all living in a commune together. He got along well with both her and her kids so eventually the four of them moved out of the commune and in together. He’s been with my grandmother ever since and currently, they are both retired in Seattle. I admire many things about him and the life his life including his bravery, empathy, and optimism.
