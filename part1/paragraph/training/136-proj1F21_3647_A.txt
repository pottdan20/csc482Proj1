In high school, I looked down upon him in condescension. John was a brash fellow then - always getting into more than his fair share of trouble, and his reputation preceded him in an infamous sort of way. We were not close in high school at all, but we interacted enough to be more than acquaintances but less than friends. We were actually on the same tennis team, and perhaps the reason I regarded him in a negative light was due to the fact that my perception of him fell flat in the face of the rumors of his exploits.
