Something interesting I find about my car is that when I am in it, I never think about wanting another car. When I'm not in my car I will often see cars on the road and think to myself how I may want said vehicle. It's easy to get caught up in how other cars look or perform and think they would be better than mine. Surely many cars would be better than mine, and eventually I will get a new car as mine will either break down or I will finally switch to an electric vehicle. But, when I'm in my car, I never feel the need for something else. My car does exactly what it's supposed to. It gets me from point a to b.Â
