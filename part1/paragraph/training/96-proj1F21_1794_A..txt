When my grandfather was 18, he enrolled in MIT studying chemical engineering. During his first semester there, army recruiters came to the campus to encourage able-bodied young men to sign up for the draft to help fight Nazi Germany in World War II. He and one of his buddies felt a strong urge to serve, and so he signed up to join the air force. It wasn't until halfway through his second year, in 1942, that he was called to serve and started his training as a B-17 bombardier.
