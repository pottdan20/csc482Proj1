These densely knit cities, with narrow, winding streets designed for walking, are a natural fit for public transit systems that can travel underground. It can tie together disparate parts of the city that would be otherwise difficult to reach over ground, without disrupting life above ground in the same way that a highway can cut a city in half. While roads feel to me like a necessary evil in the modern American city, metro systems feel like the lifeblood of a city, in the same way a river can provide a communal space for transportation and enjoyment.
