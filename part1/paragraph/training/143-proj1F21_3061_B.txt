One drawback to my Land Cruiser is the gas mileage. On a good day, I can average about 15 miles per gallon on the highway. However, this does not particularly bother me. I bike to work and school, leaving the Land Cruiser to be used for fun and hobbies. I can fit multiple large surfboards and a few friends without having to strap anything to the roof. I can also go off road and sleep in the car to camp. For these conveniences, I am willing to pay the price of driving a larger car.
