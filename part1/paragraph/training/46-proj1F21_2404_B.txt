Setting aside physical descriptors to explain the minivan's particular interest to me proves to be difficult due to the aforementioned lack of memories and investment. The car was simply "the car," that thing we get into when we're going to school, buying groceries, visiting family, and a myriad of other mundane activities. Perhaps in the long ago, I could have proffered a list of the interesting stories, experiences and memories of such, that gave the vehicle a more nuanced meaning, but that time has long since passed.
