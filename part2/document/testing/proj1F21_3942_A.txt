One of the biggest role models in my life was a man by the name of George Culver. Baseball is really important in my family. My brothers and I grew up playing the game. My dad always pushed us to be better, and he realized that baseball could take us to a lot of places if we became good enough. While I decided to take a different route, my two brothers went on to play for division one colleges, and my oldest brother even got to play in the minor league farm system for the Pittsburgh Pirates. While our dad pushed us, it was George who taught us the important complexities of the game and gave us each the opportunity to succeed.
 
George Culver is a well-known individual in Bakersfield, California. He spent his high school and college years playing baseball. He was eventually signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1963 but didn't have his first start until he was a Cleveland Indian in 1966. During one of his most notable appearances in the major leagues, George threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in July of 1968. A no-hitter basically means that he didn't allow the other team to get a single hit during the entire game, which is not easy by any means. After retiring as a player, he went on to be a minor league manager and pitching coordinator for the Dodgers. It was during the latter half of his coaching years when my family came to know him. My dad took us to get pitching lessons from him, and ever since then, he's practically been a part of our family.
 
George was not a normal person by any means. He held himself in a very high regard to the point where it became comical. If you pointed out to him that his baseball card wouldn't sell on eBay for a penny, he would be quick to tell you that if he signed it, it would go for thousands of dollars. If you asked him what is was like to pitch against Hank Aaron, one of the greatest hitters in baseball history, George would brag about how he was the easiest hitter to pitch to in the league. George was also very quick to tell a joke if the opportunity arose. One of the first things he tells you when he teaches you how to throw a curveball is that it's like having a bad girlfriend. Sometimes it's there and sometimes it's gone. There was one game where my own girlfriend at the time had decided to come and watch me play. After the game, George goes up to her and asks her if she's blind, implying that she'd only date me if she couldn't see my face. He was a real funny guy.
 
Aside from his jokes, George cared deeply about the game of baseball. He was always willing to help anybody that loved the game as much as he did. My brothers and I were fortunate enough to be taken under his wing. George taught us how to pitch, how to set up hitters, when to expect hit and runs, and so much more. Not only that, he put each of us on his own high school club team that he coached so we could get as much game experience as we could. George gave us the opportunity to take the game as far as we could go with it.
 
What I loved about George was that he made baseball feel like a game rather than a chore. When you play on more competitive teams, the coaches can get really toxic. These are the same type of coaches that pull players off the field when they make a single mistake. This can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on players. With George, I never felt this. When he put you in a position, he had full confidence in your ability to play that spot. If you made a mistake, he would tell you to shake it off and get the next one. His non-stop jokes in the dugout would have you laughing so much, you'd be crying by the time you got back out on the field. There was no pressure and no unrealistic expectations. That's what I admired most about him. George made baseball fun and carefree. The way it should be.
