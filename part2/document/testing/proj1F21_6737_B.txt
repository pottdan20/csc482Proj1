My vehicle of choice is a Honda Fit.
It is new for me, but not particularly new in general. I purchased it right before moving up to San Luis Obispo, because while my previous car was still running well it was getting old enough that I would not necessarily want to count on it for long drives between San Luis Obispo and home. I bought it from my mom's college roommate's neighbor, who was apparently having a hard time selling a care that had stickshift. I am glad I got the car because the new car has gone roughly 50 thousand miles less than my previous car, and selling the previous car covered a little over half the cost of the new one.
Although it is new for me, it is not particularly a departure from cars I have driven before. Amusingly, this is the fourth Honda Fit that is owned in my extended family. Like my previous car, it is red and has a stickshift, which in my humble opinion are the two most important qualities in a car. My one gripe about it is that the leather on the steering wheel is starting to flake off, and I need to buy a steering wheel cover soon (also, the DMV virtual office for online title transfers is really not very good, but that isn't particularly the fault of the car).
Right now I use it mainly to shop for groceries, sometimes to commute to campus, or to visit a church. Inside the car right now is some jumper cables and a first-aid kit in the back, some registration papers and a spare mask in the front, and one or two bags that I haven't bothered to unpack yet. The gas cap is on the driver's side, I think. The trunk is a regular hatchback that can fit a pretty decent amount if you drop down the seats (read: two tables, two chairs, and a lot of baggage).
So in conclusion, I have now described my car. I haven't been driving it very long so there's not really a lot to say about it, but if you've read this then now you know just about as much about it as I do.
