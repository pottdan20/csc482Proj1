My favorite person is Elon Musk. Elon Musk is so smart and he is going to save humanity and solve all of our biggest problems. Elon is so smart that he may have invented the Tesla. Some reports say he only bought the company, though.
Elon Musk comes from a humble South African background. His father owned an emerald mine for a few years. However, Elon Musk became independently wealthy from the internet boom in the 90s.
Elon Musk made his initial fortune by selling his first company, Zip2, for over 300 million dollars (where he had a 7% stake). He then went on to found a company that eventually became PayPal. Elon eventually went on to found/invest/have some role in companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink.
Neuralink seems pretty cool at first glance. Like many neural interfaces, the company is first targeting diseases that could be improved by a brain-machine interface. However, the long term goal is a consumer brain machine interface. I'm currently happy enough sequestering gmail to my laptop screen. I don't look forward to the day gmail becomes embedded in my brain. However, if Elon thinks it's a good idea, it must be best for humanity.
SpaceX is also a pretty cool venture. I can't wait for the first interplanetary Amazon warehouse. In the meantime, we can look forward to getting wifi from satellites.
