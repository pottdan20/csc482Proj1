I've never been much into cars, bikes, and I'm certainly not a fan of walking. These modes of transportation have always felt mundane, just a boring means of getting from point A to point B. Unlike those options, airplanes clearly shine as the best vehicle to transport humans. They have great food, high speeds, and are full of wonderful people to meet.
 
First of all, airplane food is fantastic addition to every flight. For absolutely no additional price, flight attendants will hand out snacks, typically a small bag of pretzels. On longer flights, they provide a delicious, fulfilling meal to sustain you as you fly to your destination. Is it lunch? Is it dinner? Nobody knows what time or even what time zone you're in so might as well eat up.
 
As you enjoy this complimentary meal, you're zooming across the world at blazing speeds and experiencing the miracle of flight. If you're lucky enough, you can sit near the wings and watch the wing flaps open and close to control lift as the plane takes off and lands. There's truly no better way to travel than to mildly fear for your life on each landing!
 
The best part is you can experience all of this surrounded by strangers. Unlike personal transportation where you are among friends or family, airplanes have you sitting shoulder to shoulder with absolute strangers. Every iteration of planes has you sitting closer to these strangers in new innovative ways. This enables the airline to fit more passengers which means more profit!
 
All in all, I hope you can understand why I enjoy airplanes so much. It is truly a unique experience that makes me feel lucky to be living in these modern times. Next time you need to travel a long distance, I hope you will consider flying there!
