One of my idols is Kobe Bean Bryant. He was a professional basketball player in the NBA. He played in the NBA from 1999 to 2016. What I admired about him the most was his unbelievable work ethic. His work ethic and insane competitiveness are what made him one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
 
Kobe Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia. He got drafted to the NBA in 1999, and he ended up playing for the Los Angles Lakers for his entire career. It was during his time in the league where he coined the term, Mamba Mentality. The Mamba Mentality is a mindset for constant self-improvement in the pursuit of your highest potential in life. With this mentality, he became the best basketball player of his time.
 
Kobe outworked all his teammates and opponents. He would wake up and complete an entire workout before his teammates had even arrived at the gym. That is the work ethic that inspires me. He knew he could be better than everybody else by outworking them. I also admire him because he was never afraid to fail. One of my favorite quotes from him was, “If you are afraid to fail, then you’re probably going to fail.” No moment was too bright for Kobe and that is something I admire.
 
Even after Kobe retired, he kept the same mentality. He went on to win an Oscar for the best animated short in 2018. He also wrote several children’s books and young adult novels. However, his most notable book is The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, where he gave readers insight into how he approached the game and what the Mamba Mentality was all about. It’s amazing to see that Kobe kept the same mentality for everything he did and not just basketball.
 
Sadly, Kobe Bryant died in a tragic helicopter accident on January 26, 2020. He has inspired so many people like me to put in the work and never be afraid of failure. Now, he is a global symbol of hard work and the Mamba Mentality.
