When I was a child, my family owned a red 1998 Ford Explorer. It was the first car my parents purchased after I was born, and was the primary means of shuttling my brother and I around as toddlers. For almost 90,000 miles over a decade, this SUV performed admirably; but, as with all cars, age finally got to it. After a series of unfortunate events, we decided it was time to upgrade, and sold our Ford “Exploder”.
One of the first times it broke down on us was on our way back to Washington at the end of a family trip to California. My mother was driving us up Highway 97 in Oregon near Klamath Falls, when she noticed the water temperature starting to rise at a concerning rate. Shortly thereafter, the power steering failed entirely. Seeing as we were traveling at roughly 70 mph, this was not ideal. She managed to coast our Ford into a parking lot for a city park right off the highway more gently than she had any right to. After having it towed to a mechanic, we discovered that part of the thermostat had disintegrated, jamming the water pump, and breaking the serpentine belt. All in all, a rather costly and unexpected detour.
The second major failure that I remember happened at Lassen National Park. After a full day of hiking, my brother, my mom, my grandparents and I were all prepared to drive back to the lodge for a hot meal and a good night’s rest. Unfortunately, the Exploder had other plans. Upon attempting to start it and shift it into drive, my mom discovered it was stuck in 4WD low. It took nearly 20 minutes of doing laps around the parking lot, shifting in and out of drive, before it dislodged. That issue turned out to be an issue with the transfer case, costing almost $3,000.
The final straw was also at a national park, this time at Mount Rainier. After another long day of hiking, we arrived at the doors of our trusty Ford, only to find out that it would not start. Being 5,400 feet up did not help matters either. We had to have it towed down the mountain to the little town of Morton, which was only just large enough to have a dealership. From there, we had to have my grandmother bring my mom’s brand new CR-V all the way from home.
Less than six months after that incident, we sold that car to a dealership. Despite all the time I spent in it, I have no nostalgia for it. Being stranded in faraway places, on the side of a mountain, and even in our own driveway will do that to you, I guess. I really do pity the poor soul who bought our old Exploder.
