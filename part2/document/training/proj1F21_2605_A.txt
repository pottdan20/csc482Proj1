My favorite person is my high school headmaster Mr Who. He was also teaching us English class. He was passionate about teaching and helping students achieve their academic goals. I learned not only great English lessons, but also how to be a better person from him. 
 
My high school was a boarding school, and I and seven other boys were living in a dorm room. In the first year there, we often felt homesick, and  we didn’t know each other well and had no idea how to get along. Mr Who would come to visit us in our dorm room, often with snacks and fruits.  We then would have chats and jokes and the roommates quickly knew each other.  After several weeks, we could shift our focus from being homesick to studying.
 
I was interested in English class during middle school, but felt I could do better. Then I had Mr Who. As a part of the English curriculum, students practice heavily on grammar, reading and writing in English. Mr Who had a great schedule, so that we were not burnt out with one specific subject. We would practice one subject at a time and move onto the next one before we got bored. The strategy worked well. The whole class were interested in learning and practicing our English skills, and  our class average English score would alway rank top 3 across multiple peer classes. It was because of Mr Who, that I became strong and confident in My English skills.
 
As high-schoolers, it was important that we prepare and plan early for our college applications. We often feel overwhelmed, as we didn’t know what we wanted to do after graduation from high school. Mr Who knew this too well and was experienced in guiding students into their own choices. He would ask senior students to share their experiences with us, provide us plenty of information about the timeline of college applications, majors, scholarship, etc. 
 
I am so happy that I had Mr Who as my high school headmaster. He was a great role model and I often think of him and get inspiration from him. Thanks, Mr Who.
