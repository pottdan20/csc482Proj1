Overall, I can say that I was happy with the car. It does its job, and does it well, with very little hitches so far. To write a full review on it though, I would need to have driven it for considerably longer(say 2-3 years) to really reveal underlying problems. This overall is the reason why car reviews are a little misleading. Often, hidden problems will not have come out for many years, especially if they are engineering related. This means that reviews are sometimes misleading for all categories of products, but especially for cars which can remain in use for decades.
