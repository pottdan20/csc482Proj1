When I turned 16, I was ready to gain some independence, even if I had to drive a 22-year-old car. The car was sitting on our lot for a few years, so it had collected a bit of dust and rust over the years. However, I was ready to do whatever was necessary to get the car fixed up and drivable again. After only a few months of driving, the engine started to have some problems. One day when I was driving the car, the engine decided to overheat in the middle of the highway. It seemed that the car had finally had enough. So, we made the difficult decision to retire Betsy and give the car to some kid who was willing to spend the time to fix it up.
