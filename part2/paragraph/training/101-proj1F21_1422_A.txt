She's a huge animal person. Her house has a level in between the basement and the garage and that entire space is just dedicated to different animals that her family fosters. She currently has a very old and quite large dog named Lucy who happens to not have eyes. She also has two rabbits. Arya is vegan and is the kind of person who refuses to kill any bug in the house. However, if it happens to be a spider, all the rules of the game change.
