How did my WonderMobile get its name? Well, let me tell you... Back in high school I was really into superhero movies. When Wonder Woman came out, I went to see it several times in theaters because all my friends needed to see it! And I started driving right around then, so I combined Bat Mobile with Wonder Woman to form the awesome name, The WonderMobile.Â
