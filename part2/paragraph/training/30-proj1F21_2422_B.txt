I think my car has to be the vehicle I write about. There is nothing special about it. It's not a particularly nice car, I don't plan on keeping it for the rest of my life, it has even been the source of a lot of frustration. But its mine. As I said, my car is nothing special. It's a four door, black sedan. It goes where I tell it to and nothing more. But it is a lot more than that. For me, my car is a source a freedom and joy and opportunity. Often times my car feels like home.Â
