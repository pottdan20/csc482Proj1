I think its important to have a friend who support you but also tells you when you're making a mistake. She's that friend for me. She's always been a huge supporter and also pushed me when I needed it. She's also never been afraid to call me out on my mistakes. In terms of mistakes, one thing that I appreciate a lot about her is that she's always trying to grow from her mistakes and is very introspective about her behavior.
