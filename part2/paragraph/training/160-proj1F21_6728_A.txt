But, as the show progresses, he learns and matures as a person, learning that his place and self-worth is his own to decide. To help him is his uncle Iroh, who is also one of the best characters in animated show history. Uncle Iroh acts as a guide, pushing Zuko in the right direction while at the same time allowing Zuko to face his trials and come to his own realizations by himself. Through Iroh, Zuko learns familial love and is able to break himself away from his father's overbearing presence in his mind.
