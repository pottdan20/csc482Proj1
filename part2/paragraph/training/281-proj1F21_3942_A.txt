What I loved about George was that he made baseball feel like a game rather than a chore. When you play on more competitive teams, the coaches can get really toxic. These are the same type of coaches that pull players off the field when they make a single mistake. This can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on players. With George, I never felt this. When he put you in a position, he had full confidence in your ability to play that spot. If you made a mistake, he would tell you to shake it off and get the next one. His non-stop jokes in the dugout would have you laughing so much, you'd be crying by the time you got back out on the field. There was no pressure and no unrealistic expectations. That's what I admired most about him. George made baseball fun and carefree. The way it should be.
