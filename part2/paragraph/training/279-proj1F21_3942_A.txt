George was not a normal person by any means. He held himself in a very high regard to the point where it became comical. If you pointed out to him that his baseball card wouldn't sell on eBay for a penny, he would be quick to tell you that if he signed it, it would go for thousands of dollars. If you asked him what is was like to pitch against Hank Aaron, one of the greatest hitters in baseball history, George would brag about how he was the easiest hitter to pitch to in the league. George was also very quick to tell a joke if the opportunity arose. One of the first things he tells you when he teaches you how to throw a curveball is that it's like having a bad girlfriend. Sometimes it's there and sometimes it's gone. There was one game where my own girlfriend at the time had decided to come and watch me play. After the game, George goes up to her and asks her if she's blind, implying that she'd only date me if she couldn't see my face. He was a real funny guy.
