So I had a skateboard. The board is short and thin, has hard wheels, and tan grip tape. On the bottom, it has a beautiful illustration of a jungle scene and toucans. I love the design, but it was mostly destroyed from all the use. I started to ride the thing, and it was pretty difficult to use. Its small size made every trick I tried to learn way more difficult, and its tight trucks made it hard to turn. Thankfully, my roommate showed me how to perform maintenance and fix that problem, so beyond that, the board worked just fine.
