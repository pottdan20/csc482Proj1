Another feature my car has that I really value is the backup camera. Â My old car did not have a backup camera, so I was forced to turn around and use the rearview mirror. The backup camera lets me reverse the car without having to turn around or even look at the rearview mirror. The camera may be a small thing but it provides me with a better driver experience.
