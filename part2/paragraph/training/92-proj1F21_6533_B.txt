The Dreamliner is by far the superior aircraft in the civilian air travel space. I personally am willing to pay more for a flight on a 787 over a cheaper flight on another aircraft because of the great value it adds to my trip. Though there are other aircraft which are larger, faster, and with longer range, the 787 is overall my top choice and recommendation for anyone planning a long flight.
