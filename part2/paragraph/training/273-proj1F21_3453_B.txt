The El Camino is a two-door coupe utility vehicle manufactured by Chevrolet starting in 1959. Not quite a pickup truck, but definitely not a standard car either, it's an interesting combination of two vehicle types. Originally adapted from the standard two-door Chevrolet station wagon, the El Camino has a two-door cab with a cargo bed integrated into the back. This style of car with an integrated truck bed was first demonstrated by the roadster utility in the 1920's, and continued to grow in popularity in the decades that followed. In response to the success of the Ford Ranchero, Chevrolet introduced the El Camino as their own coupe utility to compete in the growing market. With the first produced in 1959, Chevy continued production all the way up until the final El Camino was produced in 1987.Â
