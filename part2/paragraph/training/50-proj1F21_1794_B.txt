I went to the SLO Bike Kitchen later than day and picked up a new bike they hadn't gotten to refurbishing yet for $100. All their bikes are donated, and they repair them for resale. They have a deal where any bike they haven't touched yet is sold as-is for $100. Well, when I went I asked the worker if I could test-ride one of them and he immediately asked me "Oh the mountain bike on the end there?", gesturing to the bike I had in mind. This alerted me that my intuition on bike quality was good and I was getting an absolute steal on a fairly nice, decently maintained mountain bike, that I ride to this day. It's no red Marin, but it's doing a great job as its cheap replacement.
