A 2008 Yamaha WR250R is the motorcycle that I've come to love in the past few years. While motorcycling is an activity primarily used as a means for transportation, I've grown to enjoy the rides for the sake of riding it. There is a strong sense of accomplishment that I receive when you trail a route that could be considered tough or challenging. One of my favorite routes to drive is going along highway 1 from Big Sur to Morro Bay.
