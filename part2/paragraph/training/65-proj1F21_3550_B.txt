Often times, when I ride my bike with no purpose in particular, I will call two of my best friends, Brittney and Gary, and talk to them during the ride. I enjoy just biking around the city - talking to friends and having no real goal in mind. This has become a major stress reliever for me over the years, as well as one of my favorite past times, especially during COVID when I wasn't able to see my friends in person. I'm not traditionally a sentimental person, but I have become a bit attached to the bike - as rickety as it can be - and I've considered asking my sister if I can buy it from her and take it to a bike shop to get repaired.
