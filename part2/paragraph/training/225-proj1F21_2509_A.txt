Even after Kobe retired, he kept the same mentality. He went on to win an Oscar for the best animated short in 2018. He also wrote several children’s books and young adult novels. However, his most notable book is The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, where he gave readers insight into how he approached the game and what the Mamba Mentality was all about. It’s amazing to see that Kobe kept the same mentality for everything he did and not just basketball.
