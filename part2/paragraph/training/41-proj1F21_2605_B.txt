We were having our gap year and wanted to travel by car. When we first saw the post of the sale, we were hooked. This was our dream car. The car was maintained well and in great shape. The maroon color was a killer color.  We decided to take it even though the sale price was a bit beyond our budget. We had our friend drive to the place where the car was located. The seller was nice enough to allow us to have the car with a lower price. We couldn’t be more happy.
