I've never been much into cars, bikes, and I'm certainly not a fan of walking. These modes of transportation have always felt mundane, just a boring means of getting from point A to point B. Unlike those options, airplanes clearly shine as the best vehicle to transport humans. They have great food, high speeds, and are full of wonderful people to meet.
