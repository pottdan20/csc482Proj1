A common criticism levied against Lynch's works is that they are sometimes too philosophical or don't make sense. Not only is this a very lazy remark that aims to skirt real discussion/criticism, it's also usually employed by people who haven't even watched a single film or short of his in its entirety. Allowing for the possibility of multiple interpretations of your work is good, even if your work does not point to one as the "more valid" interpretation. The philosophical bent of the films is much appreciated. Blue Velvet might just be a cinematic embodiment of Kotarbinskian reism, while simultaneously Lynch's other works thematically oppose it. Mulholland Drive excellently utilizes and undercuts the watcher becoming the watched motif in a way that rivals its previous deft instantiations, from the verses of Du Fu and Kobayashi Issa to the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges ("The Circular Ruins") and Julio Cortazar ("The Continuity of Parks"). Of course, there are multiple philosophical implications present in each of his larger works, but even forcing an audience member to latch onto just one is a great way to ensure your movie is experienced ("stays alive") after they have watched it. It is true that David Lynch isn't alone in making films that broach the philosophical, but his are coupled with the right amount of mystery (unlike Hollis Frampton or Derek Jarman) and distanced from expected knowledge (unlike Charlie Kauffman) to be the most enjoyable.
