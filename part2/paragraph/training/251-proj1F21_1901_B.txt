The reliability, engine, and the sentimental value of my Lexus LS 400 are key reasons why I find my car interesting. It has truly been a surprise to have a vehicle that has worked as reliably as this car has, and I continue to be amazed that it has not yet had many major problems. Perhaps there will be a time in the future where I will be able to get the car back.
