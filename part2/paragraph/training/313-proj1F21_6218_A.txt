Once a year Santa travels the whole world and visits families everywhere just to give presents to those who have been good. So not only is he a very generous man who will donate, sometimes quite expensive, items to kids without expecting anything in return, but he will also only give these presents to the nice kids, creating an incentive for children all over the world to behave well all year round. So while making people happy with gifts, he also makes the world and the homes of many families a better place by keeping the kids in check. He also manages to travel around the whole world visiting up to millions of families in just one day which is incredible.
