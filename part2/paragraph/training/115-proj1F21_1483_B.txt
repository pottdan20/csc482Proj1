Biking also fostered my love for nature. There were brooks nearby that I loved recreationally biking near. As the wind rippled across my face, I couldn't help but feel a sense of divine elation, like horned Cernunnos himself was breathing onto my face. In the winter, the wind was not gentle but fierce. It bit at your skin, emulating an army of ants gnawing their way in. However, it made one feel alive, acting as its own balm in Gilead. Rarely, when it was snowing out but not icy enough to make cycling dangerous, I would to my parents' dismay venture past those same brooks and adjacent areas. While darting across the roads, I would stick my tongue out to catch snowflakes and feel them melt against my skin. The vanishing of the snowflakes mirrored my stress vanishing as a result of roaming around the serene milieu.
