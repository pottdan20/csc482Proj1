Another one of my grandfather’s traits that caused me to choose him for this assignment is his skill as a conversationalist and not just a performer. Whenever I call my father’s parents, I speak to both my grandmother and my grandfather. The contrast could not be starker. I generally need to ask my grandmother one of two questions before she launches into a drawn-out description of her day-to-day life, leaving me simply to listen. If she does ask me anything it will be something too broad to easily answer like “What’s up in your life?” In contrast, my grandfather usually comes to the conversation with some interesting topic in mind like whether the unvaccinated COVID-19 patients should be allowed to take up beds in full hospitals in Eastern Washington, or whether they should be turned away to keep the beds open for heart attack victims. He does an excellent job at listening at least as much as he talks and at the very least acts very convincingly like he’s interested in what I have to say. By contrast, the few times I’ve talked about politics or the news with my grandmother, any point of disagreement between us, no matter how small, causes her great anguish. By asking interesting questions and being open to talking about them my grandfather has always made me look forward to talking to him.
