Philosophy is Lucas' second favorite subject after math. He is particularly concerned with describing the existence of the soul, and of consciousness. I have spent quite some time discussing this with him, but his knowledge goes far beyond what I can comprehend. When one is presented with the problem of determining whether an entity is conscious, it is necessary to first define consciousness. This definition can vary depending on the entity being described, which makes the problem very difficult to generalize. In fact, the definition of consciousness is so elusive, Lucas is hesitant to even make the claim that he himself is conscious. This lends itself to an existential paradox, something which has plagued Lucas for quite some time, and that I tend to avoid altogether.
