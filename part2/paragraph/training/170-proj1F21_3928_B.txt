My car has some pretty neat features too. It has smart cruise control which is a necessity for long drives. I can set a speed and my car practically drives itself. Not as fancy as Tesla's autopilot, but it will brake and maintain a preset distance, leaving me to man the steering wheel. Also, it has lights and sensors on the mirrors, and if someone is in my blind spot, the lights will flare up letting me know someone is there.
