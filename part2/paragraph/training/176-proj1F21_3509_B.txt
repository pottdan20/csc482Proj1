Less than six months after that incident, we sold that car to a dealership. Despite all the time I spent in it, I have no nostalgia for it. Being stranded in faraway places, on the side of a mountain, and even in our own driveway will do that to you, I guess. I really do pity the poor soul who bought our old Exploder.
