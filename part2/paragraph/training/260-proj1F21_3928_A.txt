After our Europe travels, Kira and I went straight into WOW pre-week. We trained for five days straight and her sarcasm was the only thing keeping me going through those 7am meetings. We had 24 WOWies and they sorted the groups by first name, so we bonded over the difficulty of dealing with 5 Emmas. Although we had really different leadership styles, we complemented each other really well and made it through the week together. And best of all, our WOWies had a good time!
