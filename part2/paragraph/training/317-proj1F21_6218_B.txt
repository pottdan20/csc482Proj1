The bicycle is a feat of human accomplishments in transportation. A lightweight vehicle that is as easy to use as it is to walk, but much faster. Even small kids can bike well, and you don't even need a license to operate it. A bicyclist can often fit through narrow passages as well if necessary, something that many other vehicles are not capable of.
