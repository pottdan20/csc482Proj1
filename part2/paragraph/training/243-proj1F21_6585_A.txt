While Tchaikovsky's music is still unmistakably Russian sounding, it was initially panned for not being Russian enough. His confidence to not change his sound knowing it was what he liked is my favorite characteristic of his. Eventually, his sound was solidified as Russian audiences grew accustomed to it. This inevitably lead to his music being heard within the rest of Europe as well, where it became an immediate success.
