I love having a car and the freedom that comes with it. Especially living in San Luis Obispo, with the beach and mountains so close nearby, it has been a game-changer to finally have my car with me. I love being able to hop in and arrive at Pismo Beach in fifteen minutes, or make spontaneous trips to Trader Joes when I run out of food. Poor freshman trapped on campus with only their two feet to get around. I guess it's time for me to pay it forward and drive them around, just as upperclassman did for me back in the day.
