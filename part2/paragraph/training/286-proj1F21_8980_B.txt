Although my car does have some wear and tear, I am very grateful for the ease and convenience it brings to my daily life. Thanks to my car, I am able to drive the three hours up to the Bay Area to visit my family often. I donâ€™t have to arrange my day around the bus schedule, nor do I have to rely on friends for rides. I can transport many things along with me as I travel, making it much more convenient to move.
