Jonathan Blow is the creator of the popular games The Witness and Braid. I have not played Braid, but have played nearly all of The Witness. In The Witness, you explore an island full of puzzles. Throughout the game, you find various clips of videos and audio logs, each of which contains some meaningful talk or quote. Every single one of the quotes put me on my ass and caused some serious self-examination. After playing through a lot of the game and having numerous experiences of this kind, I decided to check out the game's author. Jonathan Blow's home page on the internet is a basic html document with some links to various talks, some by Richard Feynman, some by other game developers. In exploring this site, I found a number of people who I relate to; I found my people. These were people who see the world with a sense of awe and wonder. People who were dedicated to scientific inquiry and to beauty all at once. I had never seen such spectacular people before, and it made me feel at home. The first thing about Jonathan Blow that I am thankful for is that he led me to a community.
