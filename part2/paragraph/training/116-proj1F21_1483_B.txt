My fondness of riding a bike also follows from the peacefulness that followed. Holding the handlebars, having my feet either firmly planted on the pedals or dangling off to the side, posture leaning forward allows one to assume a state of mind clear of distractions. The path ahead demands your focus. The sky's maternal splendor grips your mind concernedly, introducing beauty as panacea to lift your woes. As you climb a steep, long road, the pumping in your legs gradually ascends to a bellow, rushing adrenaline through your veins. Adrenaline that calms, adrenaline that soothes.
