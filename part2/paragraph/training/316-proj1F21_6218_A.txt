Overall, Santa must the best person I have ever met, or even heard of for that matter. Giving away gifts of high monetary value to millions of children all around the world just to improve their manners of children, which must be the most unselfish thing anyone has ever done. And he is doing it each year! I think we all should take the time to say thank you to Santa when we see him next, he really deserves it!
