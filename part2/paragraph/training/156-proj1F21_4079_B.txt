There is also the added additional benefit of the electric skateboard using clean energy when compared to a car that uses fuel. It is completely electric and is great for short commutes which saves a lot of money and time. I have owned my skateboard for a little over 3 years now and it has showed no signs of battery or performance depreciation and is still going strong after 1000+ miles. I will continue to use it as a means of my daily commute while I am in school and hopefully after I graduate as well!
