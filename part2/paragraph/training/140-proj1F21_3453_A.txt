Kittle always takes his situation and makes the most of it. Drafted to a bad team with a new coaching staff and front office, Kittle was put into a tough situation from the start of his NFL career. After an unspectacular but promising rookie year, he exploded in his second season, breaking the record for receiving yards by a tight end and becoming a household name despite his team's poor record. Getting the opportunity that he wasn't afforded in college to showcase his receiving skills, he took advantage and showed the world that he's one of the best all around tight end talents in the league. He then went on to become a captain and leader of the team in 2019, helping form a core that led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance and remains in place today.Â
