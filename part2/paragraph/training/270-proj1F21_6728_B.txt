However, that is not to say the car does not have its cons. For one, the fuel economy is relatively poor at only a 29 mpg, which means that even with its expanded tank compared to the Mazda6, it actually has less overall mileage than its smaller counterpart. This means that at the end of a 200 mile drive(say the distance between San Francisco and San Luis Obispo), the CX-5 will need a refuel at the end of the trip while the Mazda6 would still be at 1/3 of a tank. On top of that, some inconveniences are still there even compared to older models. Although the road noise for the current year CX-5 has been reduced compared to past years, it is still louder than other cars of its price range, which leads to a more uncomfortable experience for longer drives.
