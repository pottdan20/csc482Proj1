One issue with the bike is that pedaling in really low gears sometimes causes the chain to slip, which makes the pedals abruptly jolt and nearly makes me crash every time. As such, I avoid configurations with gear 1 on the left and less than gear 3 on the right. Once this happened while I was riding in the bike lane on a narrow road and almost caused me to get hit by a car, and another time it made me drop all of the food I had just biked several miles to purchase. Another issue with the bike is that it constantly makes concerning noises as if it is bound to fall apart, but it has (luckily) held together thus far. Anyways, it isn't perfect.
