Stating that your bike was integral to your freedom is an eternal cliche; for me, though, it is true. In the interest of saving money, our family only had one car, and it was generally absent since my father drove it to work everyday. If I needed to be somewhere, I had to rely on my bike. I remember the thrill of donning my backpack and riding to the library, picking out books whose yellowish-pale pages I would be caressing throughout the week. Or even going to my friends house where a group of us would play Smash and Mario Party before heading outside to play soccer or frolic or just pass the spring days away. In many ways, my bicycle was a shuttle connecting the worlds in which I belonged, conveniently, and perhaps even apprehensively, passing through the places I would be rendered an outcast.
