I've always had positive experiences on ferries. Some of my favorite sunsets have been from a ferry. My family took a ferry up to Orcas Island from Anacortes and while the ride was fun, the island itself was not fun so I ended up getting on the phone with the Washington Department of Transportation in order to get a spot on the next ferry out. I took the ferry to an island this summer and it had the best view of the sunset on the water with the Seattle skyline in the background.
