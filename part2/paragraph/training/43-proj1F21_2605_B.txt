When we settled in one place, we would keep the car as empty and clean as possible. The previous owner has done a great job maintaining the car. We wanted to keep it that way.  However, nothing can be said for sure. We had an accident. At that time, we were working part time on a farm and I parked them in a wet patch. After we finished the work, being tired, I reversed the car into a tree hedge and the rear glass was shattered and the rear bumper got a big dent. I was upset about my own recklessness. The damage was done, we had to deal with it. My friend found a matching glass and helped me replace the broken one.
