One of the main reason's I have selected Paul McCartney as my favorite person is his artistic progression during the time of his life when he was in the Beatles, along with the often excessive amounts of dedication he showed to songwriting, recording and rehearsing. He began writing hit pop tunes, and gradually progressed into an unprecedented direction of artistic vision, changing the world of music as we know it. As a songwriter who will spend hours on end trying to get a specific sound from a recording, I also really respect the consistency and drive behind his songwriting repertoire. The other band members even speak of becoming annoyed with how often he would be requesting that everyone meet in the studio, even going so far as to avoid his phone calls. And yet, it would seem that a large part of the prolificness of the Beatles is due to the persistence of Paul in encouraging his other band members to create and be their best.Â
