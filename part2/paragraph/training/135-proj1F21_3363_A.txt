As my friend, he has been my support pillar. His support has definitely allowed me to stay sane and mentally healthy especially through covid and other difficult times in my life. He makes sure to always call me once a week to check up on how I am doing, and I greatly appreciate him for that. He also always gives my advice or sends a few bucks here and there to help me get by.
