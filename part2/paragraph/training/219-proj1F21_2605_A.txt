I was interested in English class during middle school, but felt I could do better. Then I had Mr Who. As a part of the English curriculum, students practice heavily on grammar, reading and writing in English. Mr Who had a great schedule, so that we were not burnt out with one specific subject. We would practice one subject at a time and move onto the next one before we got bored. The strategy worked well. The whole class were interested in learning and practicing our English skills, andÂ  our class average English score would alway rank top 3 across multiple peer classes. It was because of Mr Who, that I became strong and confident in My English skills.
