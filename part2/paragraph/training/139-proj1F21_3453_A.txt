Kittle was born in Wisconsin but moved to Iowa at a young age. Born into a football oriented family, Kittle showed enough skill in high school to be recruited to play college football at the University of Iowa. Following in his father's footsteps, he committed to Iowa where he had a solid but unspectacular college career. Despite possessing good speed and receiving ability for a tight end, Kittle was primarily used as a blocker in college, which suppressed his stats overall but allowed him to develop excellent blocking skills. The lack of receiving usage resulted in Kittle being labeled as purely a blocking tight end with limited receiving upside, despite the fact that it was his usage and not his ability that suppressed his receiving numbers. Nevertheless, the 49ers saw his potential and took a chance on him in the 5th round of the 2017 NFL draft.Â
