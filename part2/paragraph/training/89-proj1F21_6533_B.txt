The hull of the 787 is made primarily of carbon fiber, in contrast to previous Boeing aircraft which were fully aluminum. There are several advantages to this construction, which has only become possible with recent technological advances. First, carbon fiber is lighter than aluminum, which in turn makes the entire plane lighter and more fuel efficient. Though it is more expensive to manufacture initially, there are substantial savings on fuel costs as a result of switching to this design. Second, carbon fiber is slightly more rigid than aluminum. This means that when the plane experiences turbulence, there is less oscillation in the 787 than in comparably sized aluminum aircraft. As a result, travelers get to experience a smoother and more comfortable flight.
