One of my favorite people is George Kittle. George Kittle is an American football player and the starting tight end for the San Francisco 49ers. Kittle comes from a modest background as an under hyped and under recruited prospect, but has blossomed into the heart and soul of the 49ers team and "the People's Tight End". His athletic ability and physical gifts are rivaled only by his wild, infectious personality and flair for the dramatic. He's a leader for the 49ers and an icon to football fans everywhere.Â
