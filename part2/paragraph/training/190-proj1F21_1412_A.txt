After looking into his coding advice, I looked further, and found a number of videos that Blow has made concerning mindfulness. Blow is a practicing meditator and communicates his techniques in these videos. After trying a number of the techniques, I realized what wisdom I had been given! Blow's techniques have helped me deal with malaise, depression, and lots of other negative emotions. The technique works by recognizing that the emotions that we all feel so strongly are simple signals, signs that your body needs something. If you recognize this fact, then you can practice capturing those signals and isolating them, such that you don't need to feel them if you don't want to. I know, it sounds crazy, but it has worked spectacularly for me. Thus, I am also thankful to Jon Blow for his advice on meditation and mindfulness.
