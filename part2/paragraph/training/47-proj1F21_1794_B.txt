My dad and I went into a bike store on the way to dropping me off in San Luis Obispo to start my third year of school. With price in mind, we found a 2018 Marin Rock Spring 1 in a bright red for around $650. Funnily enough, that would be the last bike that bike store ever sold before closing down permanently due to lack of business.
