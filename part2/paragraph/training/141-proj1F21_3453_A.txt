George Kittle is a unicorn in the modern NFL, his play style and mindset fit for an older era. The modern NFL is centered around offense, particularly passing offense. Touchdowns, receiving yards, and flashy plays receive all the adoration of fans and the media. Modern tight ends are trending toward becoming big wide receivers with little to no blocking ability. Kittle is the one man bucking this trend. While he does have incredible receiving ability, he is also the best blocking tight end in the league. In a time when it's hard to get a top tier player with either receiving skills or blocking ability, Kittle excels at both. Not only is his skillset remarkable, his mindset is too. Most players would want the glory and admiration of catching touchdowns and scoring points, but Kittle has said on multiple occasions that he would rather land a perfect block than catch a touchdown. He loves the grind and physicality of beating an opponent on the line of scrimmage rather than 20 yards down field. His priorities show he's in it not just for the money and fame, but for the love of the game too.Â
