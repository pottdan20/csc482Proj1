Evidenced by physicists Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, or mathematicians John von Neumann and Alan Turing, the mind can venture the galaxy without ever moving, discover properties still widely used far into the future, create a game that can be used to study economics, or save countless of lives. It’s no exception for mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., who, during his lifetime, created the Nash Equilibrium, a solution concept, or a prediction for how a game will be played, for two or more player non-cooperative games in game theory, which later landed him a Nobel Prize in Economics. Born in Bluefield, West Virginia on June 13th, 1928 and died in Monroe Township, New Jersey on March 23rd, 2015, John Nash Jr. has written multiple heavily influential papers in mathematics while dealing with his schizophrenia and pressuring marriage. Nash lived with his sister and mother, nicknamed “Virginia”, and later moved out to attend Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he was recognized and accepted into Princeton University. His time at Princeton would later become one of the most important time periods in his life, as it was where he wrote his Nobel Prize winning paper on the Nash Equilibrium.
