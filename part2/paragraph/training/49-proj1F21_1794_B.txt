The next year my bike saw a lot more use. I had a job starting in the summer and continuing through the school year. I would regularly bike 10 or miles a day, and accumulated probably another 1500 miles on it throughout the year. I replaced the chain once, and each tire ones. I maintained the brakes myself and kept the bike in good shape. I stored it in my room for safekeeping as SLO is not a very safe place for bikes. On that note, when I returned to campus Winter 2021 for my 5th year, I realized I forgot my U-Lock at home. My dad had a combo lock with the fortified metal chord, and I reluctantly agreed to accept it and told him I'd go get a U-Lock later that night because the chord locks cannot be trusted. I went to target that night and the U-Locks were sold out, so I planned to go to a bike store downtown the next day when they opened. Well, when I woke up and went out to my bike the next morning, it had already been stolen - on the first day back in SLO - with just a single night of it being locked with an inferior bike lock. So long to my trusty red Marin...
