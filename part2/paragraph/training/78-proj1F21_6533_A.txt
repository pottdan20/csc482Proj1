Lucas was raised in a small farming town in North Dakota. From a young age, he displayed an incredible talent for mathematics. Since his parents are sheep farmers, Lucas spent a lot of time on sheep counting problems. For example, he would ponder the number of ways that the sheep could be arranged into the pens on his family farm. Given that only so many sheep can be fit into a pen, and that each sheep has a distinct personality and preferences, this was a challenging and multifaceted problem. Another problem was to consider the number of sheep over time as a sequence, and how this would be affected by the groupings of sheep. The study of sheep prompted Lucas' love for mathematics, which is why he ultimately chose to study it as a student at Cal Poly.Â
