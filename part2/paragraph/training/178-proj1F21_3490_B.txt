I have always had qualms with driving. Have you ever been stuck in traffic and thought, “we’re all going to same direction, why are we in 1000 different vehicles?” This question has always bothered by efficiency-minded engineering side, but it has more far-reaching effects as well. When everyone has a car, it means our cities can sprawl out, making each of us further from our neighbors. Cities such as Los Angeles that boomed at or after the invention of the automobile have them built in to their very structure; hour-long commutes are the norm, and trying to get anywhere without your own car is a nightmare. Compare this to older cities such as Paris, which developed largely vertically so that millions of people can live in a condensed space, and the effects can still be tangibly felt when you walk down the streets. Simply existing in Paris (the one time I have gone) made me feel like I was a part of a community, something which I have not felt in any American city.
