Zuko is a prince, a firstborn son, of the Fire Nation. The Fire Nation followed a strong hierarchical and traditional structure, in which rules must be strictly followed. Prince Zuko, as a young man, was banished and scarred by this father, the Fire Lord Ozai, for speaking out of turn during a meeting, then further refusing to take up an Agni Kai, a duel, with his father. He sets out to gain redemption and regain his honor by spending the next couple of years attempting to find, and kill, the Avatar, who the Fire Nation still fears due to his tremendous power.
