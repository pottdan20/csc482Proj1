But finally, it came time to hang the old thing up. Every summer has to end. I had been stunted in my trick progression for too long, and decided that a trick board would be a better board to have. In order to save some money, I just took the old busted trucks and wheels from my old board and put them into the new trick board, and I've been riding it ever since. While it's not exactly the same board that I have so many sentimental memories with, it's almost all the same hardware, and I've got the old board hung up on my wall, a constant reminder of the time we spent together. Change is good, but I'll always cherish that old skateboard, and someday soon I might swap the wheels back onto it and take it out for a spin. For old time's sake.
