My car is in decent shape, although it has lived through some unfortunate circumstances. A couple of weeks ago, my brother took my car to go out with friends. As he pulled up to an intersection, he was rear ended by the car behind him, leaving a small dent in my bumper as well as a few paint scratches. Other than that, the exterior is in good condition. I do a lot of painting as a hobby and often transport my paints and brushes in the backseat of my car. One day, one of my paint bottles was not fully closed and spilled on the ground in the back of my car. As a result, the interior of the car has a couple of paint stains.
