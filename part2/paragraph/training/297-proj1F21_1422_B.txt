I believe Grey's Anatomy's Derek Shepherd said it best when he said "I have a thing for ferry boats". My favorite method of transportation is via ferry boat. For context, a ferry boat is a very large boat that transports passengers via car to their destination. Typically ferry boats are quite large and they offer passengers the ability to be able to roam around freely on deck, leaving their car parked below or just sit in their car for the duration of the trip. Ferries typically don't cover that long distance are used more regionally and locally.Â
