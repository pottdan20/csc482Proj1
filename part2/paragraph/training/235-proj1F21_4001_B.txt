I’ve ridden my bike all over San Luis Obispo County and beyond, and it is by far my favorite vehicle. Its beautiful paint job and geometry make it an incredibly distinctive bike and make me excited to get out on the road. The excellent craftsmanship and design mean the bike is extremely dependable and fun to ride. Having owned the bike for a couple of years now I’ve made so many awesome memories while riding it and it has been an important part of my college experience. In conclusion, my bike has served as an excellent conveyance and is, without doubt, one of my most prized possession.
