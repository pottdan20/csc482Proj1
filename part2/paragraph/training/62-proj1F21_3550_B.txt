The bike is a purple Specialized 21-speed with white lettering, which was perfect for me, as purple is my favorite color. It has 3 gears on the left-hand side and 7 on the right-hand side, which gives it a wide range of settings for how much force is required to turn the pedals, and how fast the wheels turn in relation to the pedals turning. This makes the bike really effective for large hills as well as flat ground. The low gears work well for going up hills, as it allows you to pedal much easier, albeit with the wheels turning much more slowly. Mid-range gears are good for flat ground, since they provide a balance between resistance and speed. The high gears are used for going downhill, since the wheels turn much faster in relation to the pedals turning, allowing you to continue accelerating when the wheels are already revolving at a high speed.
