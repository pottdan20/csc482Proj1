One of the best and worst cars I've had in my life was a white 2000 Ford Explorer. My parents bought it around 2008 so that my oldest brother could have a car when he went off to college. The car was used, but it had very low milage and was in good condition. My brother used it for four years until he got another car. Since my other brother was already off at college with his own car at this point, my parents decided to give it to my older sister.
