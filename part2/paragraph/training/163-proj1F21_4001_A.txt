One of the features of my grandfather that endeared him to me, even as a small child, is his ability to tell incredibly good stories. As a professional actor, my grandfather knows how to perform and how to keep an audience’s attention, while many of the stories I’ve heard from my other grandparents drag and meander, his are always very entertaining. Some of my favorites include the time he met the poet Robert Frost and the time his theater group performed at Woodstock (I know these might seem fictitious, but I’ve seen the photo/video documentation of both these events). Beyond the Forest-Gump-reminiscent escapades, even the stories of my father as a small child or his work on early computers as a side office job are rendered funny and interesting by his skill as a performer. One thing I’ve noticed about people as they age is that as they become less alert and more used to receiving respect from others, their ability to tell a story decrease. By contrast, my grandfather has remained attentive to the interest of his audience and as a result can still tell a captivating story.
