The life that Darrow grew up in was far from easy. His people toiled in the depths of Mars to support the rest of society. Though life was difficult for him, it was all he knew. He was satisfied with the life he had. However, society was pitted against him, no matter how much he did to support his family, it was never enough. When his wife demanded more for life, the society killed her. Darrowâ€™s life became a path of vengeance from that point. His sole purpose was to tear down the society that had killed the only thing he valued in life. Why I truly admire Darrow, is that he was able to overcome this vengeance and work towards a society where his tragic story would not be repeated.
