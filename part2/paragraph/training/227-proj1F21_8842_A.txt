    While I haven’t had a ton of experiences to shape myself into a leader yet, I know that one leader I look up to a lot is Steve Jobs. While Steve Jobs wasn’t the best person in the world and did/said a lot of mean and hurtful things to other people, I think there were certain aspects of his leadership style that I really admire and would like to emulate. There are many leadership traits that Steve Jobs embodied, and I would like to embody as well. I think the most significant three traits were Decisiveness, Tact, and Endurance.As Apple’s CEO, Steve Jobs constantly made decisions. He made decisions to determine the aesthetics of Apple products, what kinds of markets they should target, very small details of product design, as well as many other decisions. The majority of the decisions Steve Jobs made were made very quickly, and most of the time, were also the best decisions to be made. I am reading his biography right now, and there are multiple accounts of people coming to work for Apple and being astounded to find that Steve Jobs would make decisions to change fundamental features of a product on a whim. At the corporations these people worked at beforehand, they would have to go through weeks of PowerPoint presentations to convince old board members that their product changes were the right ones to make. This was not the case with Jobs. If there was an important change that needed to be made, Jobs would be able to see the importance of the change and decide to make it at the snap of his fingers. I would like to embody Jobs’ ability to make decisions both accurately and quickly. I believe it is the ability to make the right decisions at the right times that will determine a leader’s ability to create great products. Not only was Jobs decisive though, but he also showed a great deal of Tact.
