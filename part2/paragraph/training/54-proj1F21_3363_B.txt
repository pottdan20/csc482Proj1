Buying my car with my own hard earned money gave me a different feeling of success than I had ever experienced before. It was the first item I bought that took me a few years to save up for. I remember working 10 hour days at a photography company just to drive back home in 2 hour traffic. Working there felt like absolute torture, but my car made it all worth it.
