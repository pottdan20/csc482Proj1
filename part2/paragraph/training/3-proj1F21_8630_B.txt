The best part is you can experience all of this surrounded by strangers. Unlike personal transportation where you are among friends or family, airplanes have you sitting shoulder to shoulder with absolute strangers. Every iteration of planes has you sitting closer to these strangers in new innovative ways. This enables the airline to fit more passengers which means more profit!
