Along with the overall feel of the car, its mechanics are amazing. The BMW accelerates much faster than anything I've ever driven. Sometimes when driving on an open highway like 101, if nobody is around, I'll floor the gas and accelerate from 65 to 100, and it's such an exciting feeling. You can actually feel the force of the acceleration in your gut. There's also the breaking and handling. The breaking is so nice and linear, and the handling is just so smooth around turns its kind of wild. I can really feel the difference between this car and the older cars I've driven, and I don't know if I ever want to go back.
