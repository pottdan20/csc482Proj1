In flight entertainment is very important these days, especially given that the seats are so close together and that most of the other amenities which used to be complimentary, no longer are. The 787 has excellent integrated video systems for the passengers to enjoy, consisting of a wide selection of films, TV shows, and games. It also has appropriate adapters for most of the common devices and chargers that one might have with them in flight. These systems further contribute to the positive experience of the flight, without added per-use costs on the airline. The entertainment systems on the 787 do not suffer from the consistent failures and malfunctions common on other aircraft, and as such, I have never been bored and uncomfortable on a 787 flight.
