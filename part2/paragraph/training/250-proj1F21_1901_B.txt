A final reason as to why I find this car interesting is the sentimental value that it has for me. It is the car in which I learned how to drive, and it is the first car that I every used on a daily basis. I am also proud to say that I never once crashed or damaged it in any way. As such I have several fond memories with that car, and I hope that it continues to run well into the future.
