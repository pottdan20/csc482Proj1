The car we settled on was the Mazda CX-5. This was because it had a similar height viewing angle compared to the Lexus and it being fairly cheap since we already owned a previous Mazda vehicle(previous owners got a hefty $2,000 discount!). This meant that we were able to get a new car for around $24,500, which was way cheaper than the MSRP. I was very satisfied with this purchase.
