Lastly, there's a whole host of various luxury features that are part of the car that I find so amazing. They are by no means necessary, but they are quality-of-life features that I've found add to the overall amazing driving experience. Some examples are having your speed show up in the front windscreen so you don't have to look down at the dashboard to check your speed, having built in Apple Car Play and Bluetooth, and an amazing sound system. All of these smaller features come together to create a very enjoyable luxury driving experience.
