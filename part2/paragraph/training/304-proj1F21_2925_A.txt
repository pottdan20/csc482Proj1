Perhaps my favorite invention of his was the ornithopter. Da Vinci sketched a diagram of a flying machine that flew by flapping its wings. Many of his inventions were based off studying nature. In this case, he studied the way birds and bats flew and attempted to mimic it with mechanics. He had a sophisticated flight control system that consisted of a system of pulleys, hand levers, and foot pedals. Unfortunately, he was never able to see his design come to life. Centuries later, other people attempted to build the ornithopter and eventually were able to successfully fly it.
