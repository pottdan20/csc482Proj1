When I was beginning to skateboard, I practiced on my roommate's boards. I tried out trick boards, penny boards, long boards, and dinghies, a style of short longboards. I was thinking about getting my own board, but it seemed sort of expensive, so I just used my roommate's for a long time. When it came to the end of Spring quarter, through, I needed to get my own to be able to skate over the summer. I started by looking at Facebook marketplace, and to my surprise, I found a $40 skateboard used here in San Luis Obispo! I went and picked it up, and realized a few things. For one, it was not a dinghy as was advertised, but was rather a very small wooden board, sort of like a wooden penny board. Secondly, it was way more used than I thought it would be. These things didn't stop me, though. A $40 skateboard is a pretty good deal.
