The reason why my Miyata Seventen is so important to me is that I've used it as my main form of transporation for getting to and returning from school for the past 3 years. Without it, my commute times would double at the minimum, and the ride it provides is very smooth compared to other road bikes that I have owned. While I am not sure what makes this bike feel better to ride when compared to other road bikes that I have ridden, I can say that the frame is light for such an old bike. I do think that the frame on this bike is much more comfortable than any other bike I have ridden, though. This is because it feels very sturdy, similar to how a carbon fiber frame feels, but also feels more comfortably shaped.
