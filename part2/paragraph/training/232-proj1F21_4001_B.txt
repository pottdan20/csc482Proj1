When I purchased my Aeroad, I did not know much about road bikes, or what I wanted, or what a fair valuation was. One thing that immediately drew me to the Aeroad was its stunning visual aesthetic. The model I own has a vibrant royal blue front which then fades along the top and bottom tubes through navy to a deep black by the time the body reaches the derailleur hanger. Almost every bike I've seen has a frame with one or two colors, so the fade through countless shades of blue on mine makes it very eye-catching. The bike has a sleek aerodynamic geometry and deep, distinctive carbon rims on both the front and the rear wheels. So much thought has been put into every aspect of the bike event little details, like ensuring the release levers on the breaks do not create extra drag, have been seen to. Overall the bike balances engineering and art incredibly well and knowing that I own something that beautiful is extremely satisfying.
