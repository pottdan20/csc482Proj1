The rest is history. Over this last summer, I took that board everywhere with me. Me and my girlfriend would meet at an elementary school close to our houses and skate all day long, first practicing pushing and basic techniques, then working on tricks and other fun stuff. Basically, I was on that skateboard 20 hours a week. We would take the boards up to different places around where we live, riding bike roads, streets, sidewalks, skate parks, and many more places. I have so many wonderful memories of this last summer, and nearly all of them have to do with that old skateboard.
