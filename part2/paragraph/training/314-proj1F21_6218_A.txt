He also decides to live in an inhabitable place on earth, the north pole, which makes him both unbiased towards countries and also means he does not contribute to the housing shortage in the big cities around the planet. Instead, he lives in his mansion up north with his family, employing many factory workers to build all the gifts he gives away and also supplies them with housing, helping out the world economy with that aspect as well. He also employs and houses the caretakers of his flying reindeers. All in all, Santa is just a sweet man who is loved by everyone.
