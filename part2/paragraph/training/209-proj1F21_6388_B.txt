The next owner was my aunt and father. As both of our families grew, Betsy remained the trustworthy car and lent help where it was needed. When my sister got her license, my father knew the perfect car to give her. It was quite fitting since it was bought the same year she was born, so they shared the same age. When my older brother also got to the driving age, my sister was quite enthusiastic to hand down the old car to him. Unlike my sister, my brother was quite elated to get this car. Though it didnâ€™t have much power, he would still try to force it to drift around turns, something that it was definitely not intended to do. After both my siblings went off to college, the car was parked on our lot, waiting for me to become the next owner.
