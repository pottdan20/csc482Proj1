I have a lot of fond memories of the van, I remember driving with all my friends in the back seat. I no longer can recall where we were going but I can pull a clear image of their faces and positions into my head. Some of those friends I no longer talk to and some of them I do. It makes me think about how hard it is to maintain friendships when you do not live in the same area.
