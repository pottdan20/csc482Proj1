The El Camino has a particularly special place in my heart due to the connection it has to my family. My family has owned some form of El Camino since before I was born. My grandfather drove a beautiful dark brown 1977 model for many years before passing it down to my dad. My dad kept it in the family, frequently using it to drop me and my siblings off at school throughout our childhood. It was then passed on to my older brother, who used it daily until he left for college. Unfortunately, the family car was lost in a fire before I turned sixteen, robbing me of the chance to take my turn behind the wheel of a car that had been in my family for generations. Through good luck and chance, our mechanic came across a 1984 El Camino in good condition that he was willing to sell for a fair price. With such a great opportunity to keep the family tradition alive, I pulled the trigger and bought my first and only car that we still have to this day.Â
