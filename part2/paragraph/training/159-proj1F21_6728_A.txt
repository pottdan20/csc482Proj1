I think the biggest reason why he is my favorite character is the struggles that Zuko has to face. He is first introduced as a bad guy--the one pursuing and attempting to kill or imprison the main character of the show and his friends. But as his backstory is fleshed out throughout the show, he becomes more and more relatable. As a teen, it wasn't hard to relate with his issues. Deep down, he is someone who wants to do right, but circumstances always seem to be stacked against him.Â  His family, mostly his father and sister, are narcissistic and war-mongering, and disdain him for both his soft heart and inferior fire bending skills. And him, as a teen, merely wished to find his place in the world--something that I'm sure most teens can relate to.
