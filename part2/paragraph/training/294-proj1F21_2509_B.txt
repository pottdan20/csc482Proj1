CarPlay makes it easy to listen to my own music. It syncs up to my Spotify app and lets me play from my own playlists. I can also start navigation on any of the popular navigation apps like Apple Maps or Google Maps and it will sync up to my CarPlay display. Then, I can create a split-screen display in the car where I have the navigation running on one side and have my music playing on the other side. That is the feature I utilize the most. The split-screen feature is very convenient to have when I have navigation running so that I can see the GPS directions and control the music.
