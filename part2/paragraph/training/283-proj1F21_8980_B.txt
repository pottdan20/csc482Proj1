One time, I drove my car from San Luis Obispo to Lake Tahoe. Although the drive took about eight hours, it was a very fun road trip because I traveled with friends. We listened to music, played games, and told jokes throughout the drive. Once we reached Lake Tahoe, the road became icy and I had to pull over to put chains on my tires to prevent skidding. The chains provide much more traction as they allow the tires to grip to the road.
