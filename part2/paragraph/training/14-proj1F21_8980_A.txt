Chloe is incredibly independent, confident, outgoing, and compassionate. She has a very strong set of beliefs, and has a high level of intelligence that allows her to defend those beliefs very well. She makes friends very easily, and rarely struggles to fit in with any social group. Chloe is fiercely protective of the people she cares about, and will go out of her way to support others in need. She is one of my biggest supporters, and I have always admired her qualities. I feel very lucky to have such an amazing person in my corner.
