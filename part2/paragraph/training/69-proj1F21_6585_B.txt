Other than the shifters, the parts on my Miyata are identical to the parts that it came with.The bike seat is definitely the worst part about older bikes, and my Miyata is no exception. It is flimsy, and is nothing more than thin fabric that is wrapped around a piece of cardboard. However, the rest of the seat and seat housing is very sturdy, which makes up for the little to no comfort that is provided by the seat. As a result, the seat is usually stationary when going over rocky terrain.
