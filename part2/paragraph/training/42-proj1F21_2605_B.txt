The size of the wagon was perfect. As we were traveling, we packed all our clothes, foods and other essentials in the trunk. Though it was a bit heavy and slow when we were on the road, we didn’t have much to complain about. We wanted to enjoy the road trip as much as possible. Speed was not our primary concern.
