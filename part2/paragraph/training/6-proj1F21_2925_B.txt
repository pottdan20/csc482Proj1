My Camry belonged to my father first. He bought it before I was born, and he used it for everything -- groceries, work, travel. When I was younger, my sisters and I would have an extremely difficult time falling asleep. To help us, my father would take us for night drives in the Camry. My sisters and I would huddle up in the backseat with some blankets and peer out the windows to gaze at the stars. Eventually, we would become drowsy and fall asleep in the backseat, magically waking up in our beds the next morning.
