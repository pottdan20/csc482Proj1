One of my favorite parts of the car is the technology. The car’s interface comes with Apple CarPlay. Apple CarPlay is a smarter, safer way to use your iPhone while you drive. You can get directions, make calls, send and receive messages, and enjoy your favorite music on your car’s built-in display. Since I used to drive a 2004 Toyota Camry, this new technology is a game-changer for me. In my old car, I would have to use a device to create a radio station that would allow me to play my music. However, now I can just plug my phone into a USB charging port in my car and I get an interactive display that makes my life much easier.
