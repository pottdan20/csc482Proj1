Despite its marks, I like to keep my car clean. I vacuum the interior about once a month, and take it to a drive through wash every couple of weeks. Recently, the fires in California have caused a lot of ash to fall from the sky over San Luis Obispo. This ash inevitably lands on my car and covers the roof in a layer of white dust, making it difficult to keep my car as clean as I would like it. Occasionally, a sprinkle of rain or morning dew can also leave marks on the car.
