My only vehicle at the moment is one that doesn't even actually belong to me - my sister's old mountain bike. I used to have a bike, but it was stolen from my apartment in Mustang Village, so I have been using my sister's bike for about 2 years and will continue to do so until I purchase a car later this year. Having a bike as a primary means of transportation is a bit limiting, but it is perfect for getting to various stores and restaurants that are located close to my house. It also forces me to exercise in order to get anywhere, which is an added bonus, since most of my outings involve eating fast food.
