I also admire Satoshi for his idea of a more fair financial playing field for everyone. In the first Bitcoin block, the genesis block, Satoshi included the text, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". This was a headline from a UK newspaper talking about how failing financial institutions would once again be bailed out at the expense of regular people who were not at fault for the institutions' failures. Satoshi recognized that our current financial system could be greatly improved and he created a blueprint of how to do it.
