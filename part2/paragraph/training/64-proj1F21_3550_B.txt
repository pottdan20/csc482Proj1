One of my favorite memories riding the bike was when I rode to In'n'Out Burger at nearly 1 A.M. after waking up and feeling immense hunger. It's a decently long bike ride - about 30 minutes - but I didn't mind, because biking at night is one of my favorite things in the world. Certain stretches through neighborhoods are so quiet and peaceful, with no cars and only the light of the street lamps and the moon. The main roads are also much less busy than usual, which means all of the stoplights are quick. The reward at the end of this already pleasant ride was well worth it.Â
