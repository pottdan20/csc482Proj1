I chose Satoshi Nakamoto because he is the father of blockchain technology. This technology is not widely used yet, but it has the power to totally disrupt a lot of centralized institutions and systems, such as the banks fo the financial system, and push more power out to the fringes and to the regular people who use the systems. Satoshi created the possibility of a much more equitable financial system that is not completely owned and operated by the richest 1% of people.
