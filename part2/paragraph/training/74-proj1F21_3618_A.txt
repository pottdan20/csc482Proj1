Although Nash was childish at times, his arrogance and headstrong will was still what made his life admirable. Ambrose once challenged Nash to solve the embedding problem for manifolds, a notoriously difficult problem that had been around since Riemann, a 17th century mathematician, first proposed it. When Nash gave his lecture two years after the bet with Ambrose, he made it very clear that he solved the problem merely because of the bet. This speaks volumes about who Nash is as a person, a mathematician who saw “mathematics not as a grand scheme, but as a collection of challenging problems”. Nash didn’t call himself a game theorist, or a topologist, but rather a mathematician who went to other fields that practically nobody had achieved anything. He would take this opportunity to find any problems that piqued his interest. The embedding problem proved itself to be quite a challenge for Nash, but he never gave up. Solving such an infamous problem also took a lot of courage as he brought himself into the realm where people believed what was possible and what wasn’t, and directly challenged them. After he succeeded in solving the problem, Ambrose, being the fine mathematician he is, made “his applause … as loud or louder than anyone else’s”. Moving past his childish traits, one has to truly admire what a brilliant mind Nash has when given the opportunity to see it in action.
