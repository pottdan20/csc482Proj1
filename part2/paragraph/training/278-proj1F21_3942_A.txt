George Culver is a well-known individual in Bakersfield, California. He spent his high school and college years playing baseball. He was eventually signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1963 but didn't have his first start until he was a Cleveland Indian in 1966. During one of his most notable appearances in the major leagues, George threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in July of 1968. A no-hitter basically means that he didn't allow the other team to get a single hit during the entire game, which is not easy by any means. After retiring as a player, he went on to be a minor league manager and pitching coordinator for the Dodgers. It was during the latter half of his coaching years when my family came to know him. My dad took us to get pitching lessons from him, and ever since then, he's practically been a part of our family.
