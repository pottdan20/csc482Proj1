Getting me from point a to b is all I can ask of a vehicle. The ability to travel is my favorite thing about my car. I have passed over tens of thousands of miles of road in my car. Each trip taking me to new and exciting places. My car has brought me to National Parks such as The Grand Canyon, Death Valley and Redwood; as well as cities such as San Diego and Portland. A deep desire in my life is to see as much of the world as I can. My car has been a great tool in achieving this goal and I've had many great adventures thanks to it.Â
