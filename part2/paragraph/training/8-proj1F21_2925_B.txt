In addition to making memories, I learned a lot from my Camry. Since it was an older car, it required constant maintenance. I learned how to change the oil, replace the tires, swap out the battery, and jumpstart the car. I learned how to check the coolant and the brakes and where to find all the necessary components. The majority of what I know about cars comes from working with my dad on the Camry to keep it running.
