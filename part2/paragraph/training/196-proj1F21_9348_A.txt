The reason why I chose this character to write about is mainly that I admire the strength and determination he embodies. The ability to withstand anything and persevere for the benefit of those around you is the ultimate trait of a great leader. I do not think that this will become something necessary in my own life, but I hope to display some of the strength that he does when others rely on me. I hope that, to those I love, I can become part of their own strength and help them to confront the world.
