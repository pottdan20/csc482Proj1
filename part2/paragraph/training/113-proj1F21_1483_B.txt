No other vehicle generates an emotional response in me quite the way my middle school bicycle does. I don't bike much nowadays which is a realization which evokes deep regret and longing every time it is confronted, but I certainly used to bike a lot. It was my way of exploring the meandering paths of my city, tracing out the roads with my wheels like one traces the lines on their lover's palm. The confluence of person and bike engenders a sense of connectedness with one's surroundings. A vehicle examined in the absence of its surroundings is in essence a vehicle sans transportation, an affront to its design and its Dasein. So in the rest of this essay, I will be talking about my bike but also contextualizing it in terms of its utility in my life.
