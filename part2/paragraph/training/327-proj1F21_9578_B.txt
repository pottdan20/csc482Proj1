Since their inception in the early 1900s, aircraft have long captured the imagination of humans and our longing to fly amongst the clouds. Airplanes are some of the most complex machines humans have ever built and some of the greatest feats of engineering only manifested due to the extreme constraints required of aircraft. The A10 warthog is a perfect example of this. More flying tank than airplane, this plane was introduced in 1977 at the height of the cold war. Fearful of the thousands of Soviet tanks that could cross into Western Germany and then France at a moments notice, the US Air Force required a weapon system that could take down a modern tank, while remaining durable to any weapon the enemy through at it. Thus the A10 was born.
