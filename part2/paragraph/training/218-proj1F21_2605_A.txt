My high school was a boarding school, and I and seven other boys were living in a dorm room. In the first year there, we often felt homesick, and  we didn’t know each other well and had no idea how to get along. Mr Who would come to visit us in our dorm room, often with snacks and fruits.  We then would have chats and jokes and the roommates quickly knew each other.  After several weeks, we could shift our focus from being homesick to studying.
