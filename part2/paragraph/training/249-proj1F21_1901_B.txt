Another reason why I find my car so interesting is its engine. The carâ€™s engine is a 4-liter V-8 engine, and it would have achieved about 260 horsepower off of the assembly line. These types of engines simply do not get put into cars in modern times. Because the V-8 engine is so economically inefficient, it is very difficult for car manufacturers to use such an engine and meet the environmental regulations that are in place today. As such, I feel that my car has a unique quality that may be extremely rare several years into the future. This is because many future vehicles will be electric, eliminating the need for internal combustion engines altogether. Perhaps if my car continues to run the way that it has, it may be of antique value at some point.
