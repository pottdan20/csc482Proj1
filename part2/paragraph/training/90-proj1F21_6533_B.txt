The 787 has a much more advanced system of climate control than earlier aircraft, and leaves passengers feeling fresher and less susceptible to jetlag. While most aircraft push very low humidity air through their filters, the air on the 787 is humidified to a more comfortable level. The cabin pressure is also adjusted to be more comfortable for passengers than it is on standard aircraft. I can personally attest to the effectiveness of this system. Particularly on longer flights, such as the 12 hour stretch from California to most places in Europe, the effects of the improved air conditioning system are very noticeable. Usually I get terrible allergies and congestion from the forced air systems on most aircraft, but I don't have these problems on the 787. It is easier to sleep on the 787 and feel rested on arrival than it is with any other plane.
