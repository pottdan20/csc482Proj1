One of the pitfalls of vintage bikes is their thinner tires. This leads to them not handling well on even the slightest of imperfect roads. You tend to feel every bump much more than if you were on a more modern road bike. Regardless of this, I do like my bike a lot, and have chosen it over more modern road bikes. Initially this decision was because of the unique shifters that are found on older bikes that I found interesting. Now, however, I have gotten used to riding my bike and have swapped out all of the parts that I do not like, with the exception of the seat. Once that is done, this bike will be perfect in my eyes.
