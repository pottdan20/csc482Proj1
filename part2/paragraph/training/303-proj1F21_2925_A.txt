Leonardo da Vinci was revered for his paintings. His most famous artworks were the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper, paintings that are still recognized by nearly everyone today. Credited as the founder of the High Renaissance, da Vinci largely influenced Western art. In addition to being a phenomenal painter, da Vinci was a revolutionary inventor. His notebooks depict his ingenuity -- flying machines, armored vehicles, and solar power, to name a few inventions. He was able to conceptualize them and draw detailed diagrams of them long before any of these technologies were implemented.
