Tchaikovsky also had an admirable drive to make music. He was trained as a civil servant, and he had little music education as Russia did not have a system of public music education. You had to hire a private teacher, who was usually a notable musician that was trained themselves from a young age by another musician. Additionally, Russian music theory was different from European music theory at the time, which led to its rather unique sound. Despite all of this, Tchaikovsky managed to become proficient with musical theory, and also blend Russian and European styles to form his own style.
