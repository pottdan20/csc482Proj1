Aside from his jokes, George cared deeply about the game of baseball. He was always willing to help anybody that loved the game as much as he did. My brothers and I were fortunate enough to be taken under his wing. George taught us how to pitch, how to set up hitters, when to expect hit and runs, and so much more. Not only that, he put each of us on his own high school club team that he coached so we could get as much game experience as we could. George gave us the opportunity to take the game as far as we could go with it.
