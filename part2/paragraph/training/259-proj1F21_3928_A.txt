This summer, Kira and I travelled to Europe together. We spent a week in England exploring London and the English countryside. Afterwards, we visited Ireland and finished off in Barcelona, Spain. She was the best travel buddy! We had very similar interests and wanted to see the same attractions, each the same food, and survived the same sketchy hostels together.
