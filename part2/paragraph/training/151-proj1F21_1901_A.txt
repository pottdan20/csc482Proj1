A final aspect of Hawkingâ€™s life which I admire is his work in physics. Hawking made several significant contributions to his field, helping to shape our understanding of the universe. The study of the universe is obviously important to society at large, and making a significant contribution on this front is a difficult task. Nonetheless, Hawking served as an example of how we continue to gain knowledge about the universe, progressing as a society.
