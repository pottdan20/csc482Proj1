Still, there is one prevailing feeling I have about the vehicle, that it was something very old. Well, there is also the feeling that it was quite filthy, but that is neither here nor there. The car has always seemed like VHS and floppy disks in a way: still extant at the time of my childhood, but on their way out of style. How much of that perception was true back then I cannot say for certain; I know logically it cannot be entirely correct because the car was bought new some short time after I was born, but I cannot provide any other view from memory. Indeed, I do not recall much about the vehicle because nothing especially interesting ever happened in the car; there were no major accidents nor breakdowns and no interesting travel stories tied to the vehicle because we usually rented a car if going anywhere particularly far. In the end, I suppose it was just a very serviceable tool.
