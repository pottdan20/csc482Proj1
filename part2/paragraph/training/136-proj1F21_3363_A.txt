As my mentor, he has taught me strong work ethics as well as wise decision making. My dad works in graphic design for the City of San Diego during the weekday and as a DJ on weekends. Seeing my dad work for hours on end, with his only resting day being Sunday, inspired me to work hard on all of my tasks whether they be work, school, or other activities.Â
