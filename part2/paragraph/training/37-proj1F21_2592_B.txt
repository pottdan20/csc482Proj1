Driving a nice car for a little while has actually changed my perspective on cars, and, if I have the money later on, I will definitely be purchasing a more luxury style vehicle. Let me tell you why. First of all, driving the BMW is just so much smoother than driving my old 2002 Acura MDX. It's not exactly quantifiable, but the feel of the acceleration combined with the visceral revving of the motor is just something so enjoyable, and I never thought I would enjoy it so much. Getting in the car and starting up the engine feels and sounds so nice, and it's such a great way to start my day.
