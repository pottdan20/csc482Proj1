One of my idols is Kobe Bean Bryant. He was a professional basketball player in the NBA. He played in the NBA from 1999 to 2016. What I admired about him the most was his unbelievable work ethic. His work ethic and insane competitiveness are what made him one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
