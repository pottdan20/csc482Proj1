First of all, airplane food is fantastic addition to every flight. For absolutely no additional price, flight attendants will hand out snacks, typically a small bag of pretzels. On longer flights, they provide a delicious, fulfilling meal to sustain you as you fly to your destination. Is it lunch? Is it dinner? Nobody knows what time or even what time zone you're in so might as well eat up.
