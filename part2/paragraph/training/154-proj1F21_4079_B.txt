The Boosted Board has changed my way of transporting drastically and for the better. The amount of time I save by not having to wait in traffic is massive and it is a better alternative to bikes which can be hard to use given the steep hilly roads. Skateboarding is also much more convenient than biking to class on campus since one can simply pick up the skateboard and take it with them to their class unlike bikes that need to be locked up at bike racks. With the constantly increasing number of bike thefts, it is also a concern to leave bikes unattended.
