The biggest compliment I can give Tchaikovsky is that his music for piano is not only very enjoyable to listen to, but also to play. As the composer who's music I have probably played the most, both while and after I was taking piano lessons, it was only natural that I choose him. Additionally, his life is very well documented, which means that I can easily familiarize myself with his life.
