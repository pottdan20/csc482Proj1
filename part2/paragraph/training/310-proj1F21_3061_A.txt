Neuralink seems pretty cool at first glance. Like many neural interfaces, the company is first targeting diseases that could be improved by a brain-machine interface. However, the long term goal is a consumer brain machine interface. I'm currently happy enough sequestering gmail to my laptop screen. I don't look forward to the day gmail becomes embedded in my brain. However, if Elon thinks it's a good idea, it must be best for humanity.
