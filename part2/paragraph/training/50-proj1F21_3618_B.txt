A 2008 Yamaha WR250R is the motorcycle that I've come to love in the past few years. While motorcycling is an activity primarily used as a means for transportation, I've grown to enjoy the rides for the sake of riding it. There is a strong sense of accomplishment that I receive when you trail a route that could be considered tough or challenging. One of my favorite routes to drive is going along highway 1 from Big Sur to Morro Bay.
When looking at the market for a motorcycle there are many different options at varied price points and customer applications. Luckily, my cousin who is also an avid motorcyclist was able to guide me through the process of buying a motorcycle that's worth the money. I was able to snag up the Yamaha for around 3000 dollars a few years back which at the time was a relatively good deal.
The best part about it is the best in its class of 250 CCs largely due to the engineering where they were inspired by a 1000 CC motorcycle by using a inline 4s. The benefit is that it provides a greater power thus improving the rpm of the motorcycle. This allows it have an enhanced acceleration within a small package.
Most other dirt-bikes make their power in the bottom end, but this one due to the inspiration from the higher end it makes most of its power on the top end rather than the lower end. Its better for higher speed as it handles a lot more smoothly. From the factory this bike fits the bill of being a all-rounder as it can perform as it can work well as a dirt-bike and also as a road bike. This occurs due to fact that its very approachable as the suspension is optimized and the tires are a bit of an in-between between knobby road vs off-road ones.
Not all is good though since a rather depressing fact is that while the motorcycles sold well throughout the years it was recently discontinued in the year of 2020 due to euro 5 emission standard. Overall, I truly love riding my motorcycle and believe its one of the best, if you can get one.
