Within the next several years, he met a couple of his future bandmates of the Beatles. First, he met George Harrison on the school bus, and a few years later he met his future songwriting partner John Lennon at a performance by John's band at the time, the Quarrymen. Paul was soon invited to join the band as rhythm guitarist, and George Harrison joined to play lead guitar the following year. The invitation to George Harrison was, in part, due to a lackluster performance on lead guitar by Paul McCartney, who later suggested George as an option to fill the role as lead. This shows Paul's humility, another quality I respect - many guitarists would have stubbornly persisted, trying to be the one in the spotlight. Paul instead realized that his talents lay elsewhere, and that George was more fit to play lead guitar. He also didn't let it stop him from continuing on his musical journey and contributing to the band's efforts.
