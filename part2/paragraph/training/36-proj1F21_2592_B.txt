I know that sounds kind of heartless of me, but, as the saying goes, "One person's misfortune is another's fortune". So now I have found myself as the proud driver of a 2018 BMW, and this is definitely the best car I have ever driven. I've never really been much of a car person, and I've always been bothered by the idea that cars are horrible investments (speaking strictly financially). So I always thought that driving a nice car wouldn't be that much better than driving any other car. I was wrong. I was totally wrong.
