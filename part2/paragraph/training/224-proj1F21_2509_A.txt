Kobe outworked all his teammates and opponents. He would wake up and complete an entire workout before his teammates had even arrived at the gym. That is the work ethic that inspires me. He knew he could be better than everybody else by outworking them. I also admire him because he was never afraid to fail. One of my favorite quotes from him was, “If you are afraid to fail, then you’re probably going to fail.” No moment was too bright for Kobe and that is something I admire.
