Another important reason that my road bike is one of my favorite vehicles, and even one of my favorite possessions, is its usefulness. The Aeroad is the lightest bike I have ever owned. The first ride I took it on, across the 520-Bridge in Seattle, I was barely able to keep upright; every gust of wind that came off the lake made me worried I’d fall off the bike was so light. In the intervening years I have grown used to how light and responsive the bike is and now I almost any other bike I ride feels painfully clunky and slow. In addition to the weight, the bike is extremely dependable and well made. I’ve been riding it for years now, and often fail to do the preventative maintenance that I should be. Nevertheless, the bike has yet to give me a single serious mechanical issue. The spokes have stayed taught. the wheels have stayed true. Not one of the breaks or shifting cables has needed to be replaced. Given how far I’ve ridden the bike and how little thought I put into its upkeep this is nothing short of a miracle. Overall, the Aeroad has been an extremely dependable and fun to ride bike.
