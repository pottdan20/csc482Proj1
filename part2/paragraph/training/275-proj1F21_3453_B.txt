There's so much I love about the car that it's hard to pinpoint a single feature that makes it great. The black leather bench seats are not only unique and different from modern cars, they're also the most comfortable and spacious seats I've had in any vehicle. The car drives smooth and easy; the steering wheel is so fluid and loose that it feels like steering a boat rather than a car. The windows actually "roll down" with a physical hand crank rather than the push of an electronic button. It's the ultimate car to drive around, with the added bonus of having the capabilities of a truck. You can drive it to the party and bring all the supplies with you. The cargo bed can fit almost anything you need to haul around, and the tailgate drops into the perfect seat for hanging out. The clean red and white finish on the outside is memorable and eye-catching. The smooth silhouette draws silent nods of approval from other drivers as you pull up to a light, and you'll never lose an El Camino in a parking lot.Â
