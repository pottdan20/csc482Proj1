Although somewhat rare in California, Subaru Outbacks are a popular and sought-after car in Oregon. The combination of its reliability, four wheel drive, and wagon-style utility make it an indispensable vehicle for the adventuring Oregonian to traverse snowy mountains paths, dusty deserts roads, and gravel terrain with ease. Its resale value is also very high, probably due to its great utility and durability.
