Darrow’s story started off as a tragedy, but instead of letting himself fall into vengeance, he decided to stand for more. He became the leader he knew he had to become to accomplish his dream. He found support from all people, even those who initially participated in the oppression of his people. Through his strong moral compass and perseverance to succeed he accomplished his dream in the end. These qualities that I admire in Darrow are some important qualities I try to incorporate into my own life.
