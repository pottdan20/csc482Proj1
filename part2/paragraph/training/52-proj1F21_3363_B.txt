I got my car in the summer of sophomore year of college. Before then I had no real need or reason to drive. If I needed to go somewhere, my dad would normally drive me when he got off of work or my friends would pick me up from my house if we were planning on hanging out. I did not realize how much a car can easily impact your life. When I bought it, I felt truly free. I could go wherever, whenever I wanted without any restrictions. I am not kidding when I say that I felt like I was reborn.
