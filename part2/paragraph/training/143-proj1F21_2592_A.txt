One of my favorite people is Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator of Bitcoin and he (or she or maybe even a group of people) helped start the revolutionary technology by publishing the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008. The white paper explained the Bitcoin protocol which, put simply, is a decentralized database that can also process transactions between different users in the database. Satoshi also launched the original Bitcoin implementation and basically created the first blockchain.
