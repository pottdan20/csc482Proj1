We had a fight a few years ago and our friendship became very surface level and strained. We reconnected again a few years later and we've become much strong friends because of it. We balance each other out now. She's a very nostalgic person and sometimes has a tendency to look at the past through rose-tinted lens and as a result that's taught me look at the past with both its highs and lows. I draw boundaries with people that I don't like and have no issue not interacting with them and whereas she gets along with everybody so now when we plan things we have to typically reach a compromise about who we invite and that's taught me a lot about compromise and communication.
