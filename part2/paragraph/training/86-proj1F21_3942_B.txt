I drove Blanca for around two years. The first year was awesome. I felt like I could go anywhere at any time I wanted. If I wanted to go to a friend's house, I didn't have to get a ride from my parents. The summer was miserable, but nothing I couldn't handle. Then Blanca started to break down even more. It started to make this horribly loud clicking sound whenever you stepped on the gas. If you were waiting by the curb for me to pick you up, you would be able to hear my car coming down the block before I even turned onto your street. Because of that, we changed the nickname to the Helicopter. Not only was the sound bad, but the car got harder to steer. The steering fluid reservoir had a leak in it. Every time I went to make a turn, I had to pull the steering wheel as hard as possible just to get it to move. Eventually, I got sick of the car.
