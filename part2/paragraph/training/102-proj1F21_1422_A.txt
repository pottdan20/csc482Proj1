She has excellent taste in clothes. She's always typically the best dressed and most of high school was spent raiding her closet for something to wear. She's was the one friend that did everybody's makeup before dances. Ironically, she took the longest to get ready. She's typically the last one to show because she's always late. Once, she showed up six hours late to an event. Despite being late, she's always the person you can count on to be there and bring the party. Arya is one of the best people I know and that's why I chose to write about her.
