Hawkingâ€™s continuation of his word despite his disability is an inspiration. What I most admire about Hawking is his resilience in the face his challenges. Doctors had given Hawking a life expectancy of only two years. Hawking, rather than choosing to live the rest of his life in sorrow, chose to continue with his career in physics. Hawking well outlived the two-year life expectancy that was given to him by doctors, and made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe. Personally, I think of his life as an example of how I should strive to live mine, not in the sense that I should make significant contributions to my own field, but rather that I should never just quit in the face of a challenge. Many people have faced far worse and come out successful.
