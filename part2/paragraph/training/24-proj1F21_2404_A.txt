Ultimately, I think I am drawn to such a character because they represent an ideal to which I aspire, possessing things that I do not have: a strong work ethic, decisiveness to pursue a goal in life, and a veritable wit to boot. Playing into this concept is the notion of privilege; though the nature and type are somewhat different in magnitude and impact between her and I, the fact of the matter is that in both instances money opened doors that the benefactor never had to realize were there in the first place. This was an observation pointed out to Naomi as she first failed to achieve her dream job, and I cannot help but internalize that biting truth for myself as well. The difference for me however is that as of this moment I am not working particularly hard in school nor striving towards some concrete goal, rather simply meandering through requirements and expectations; indeed, squandering said privilege. Maybe I can change that, maybe not, though I admire one who can bring their life into focus all the same. There is that nagging thought though: I wonder if having a role model that resides entirely in fiction is utter foolishness after all.
