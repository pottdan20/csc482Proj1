Chloe and her family moved to Europe in the third grade, but we stayed in touch our whole lives! My family would go to France every summer to visit my grandparents, cousins, aunts, and uncles that lived there. We would always stop for a couple of days to stay at Chloe’s family’s house and catch up, so we have all remained very close friends for almost two decades. Her family lives in the south of France, a couple of hours away from Nice.
