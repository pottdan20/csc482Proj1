Another of Hawking’s qualities that I admire is his sense of humor. Hawking appeared in several comedic television shows, some of which include The Simpsons, The Big Bang Theory, and Futurama. Hawking was also known for making wagers and having an all-around humorous personality. This is another aspect about Hawking’s life which serves as an inspiration for me. I believe that it is important not to take life too seriously and enjoy the more humorous aspects. Without doing so, we run the risk of becoming robotic as a society, lacking the joy that is important in life.
