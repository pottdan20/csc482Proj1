David Lynch is perhaps best known for the films Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, and Blue Velvet. Although I have not seen Eraserhead yet (been on my list for a long, long time), I have watched the other two and been extremely intrigued by the experience. Mulholland Drive specifically is on top 100 movie lists quite frequently, and for good reason. The story is gripping, and the cinematography is breathtaking and alluring. Astonishing visuals coupled with awe-inspiring acoustics, from the hair-raising background music designed to produce anxiety when appropriate to the cryptic, dismal melancholy of "Llorando" at Club Silencio, make watching Mulholland Drive a must-have experience. It also has one of the best jump scares in all of cinema. It is personally in my top 5 favorite films of all time. Envisioning and directing a work of such rarely paralleled beauty is remarkable in and of itself.
