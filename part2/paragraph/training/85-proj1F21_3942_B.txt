When I received Blanca, the car was still fairly good. However, it had a couple of minor problems. First, the gas gauge didn't work when it reached a quarter tank. When it reached that point, the meter would go up and down so I couldn't tell how much gas was in it. There was one day where the gauge looked like I had a full tank of gas when I knew fully well that I hadn't gassed it up in over a week. The next problem was the air conditioning. It constantly blew out hot air no matter how cold you set the temperature. This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't live in the middle of the Central Valley. Summers were very fun. These were the only problems it had when I got the car.
