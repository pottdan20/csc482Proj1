For these and numerous other reasons, my grandfather is one of my favorite people that I have in my life. He is a skilled performer and has lived a very eventful life so he can always be counted on for a good story. Beyond that, despite his good storytelling, he does not monopolize a conversation but instead is an extremely thoughtful and interesting conversationalist. Though I admire both these features, one of the defining attributes of my grandfather is his kindness to those around him. As a result, my grandfather is an amazing individual and the coolest old person I have ever met.Â
