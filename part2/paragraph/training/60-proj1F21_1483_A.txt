Lynch's work has been an enigma, source of beauty, and genuine source of inspiration in my life. I am enthused by how well he assembles works that are simultaneously commercially viable, weird, thought provoking, energetic, and entertaining. As someone who occasionally dabbles in furtively writing magical realism and philosophical fiction, I would also like to think of Lynch as an inspiration. Someday, when I learn to write well, I would like to expand on a scene or image established in a David Lynch work.
