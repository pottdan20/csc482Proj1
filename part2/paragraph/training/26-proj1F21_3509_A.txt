The aspect of his character that immediately stands out upon meeting his character is his eloquence and attention to detail. Sam has a way with words that I can only aspire to, with perfectly poignant phrases, excellent cadence, and a commitment to craft the best speech he can. In one episode, he spends an entire day writing and rewriting what was meant to be a simple birthday message for some deputy. Even a speech crafted in the car on the way to its delivery is better than what a team of others could produce in a week.
