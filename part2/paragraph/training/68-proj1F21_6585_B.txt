Unlike other Miyatas, my bike also has a more modern set of gear shifters. Usually, Miyatas come with a pair of manual shifters that are attached to the bottom tube of the frame. However, I replaced those because I felt more comfortable using the more modern ones, especially since they are much quicker to use. This forced me to replace the handlebars too, since the new shifters can not be mounted onto the old Â handlebars.
