Born in Liverpool, England on June 18th, 1942 as James Paul McCartney, Paul grew up listening to American rhythm and blues and idolizing artists such as Little Richard. He was encouraged to be musical from a young age by his father, who was a pianist, trumpeter and leader of the 1920s band, Jim Mac's Jazz Band. Surprisingly, when his father encouraged him to begin auditioning for various choirs at age 11, he was initially rejected. This is one of the reasons for my admiration of McCartney - at such a young age, he was told that he wasn't good enough, but he refused to listen. Little did they know, he would grow up to be one of the most famous singers of all time, and would be highly regarded for his wide range, precision and creativity characteristic of his vocal performances.
