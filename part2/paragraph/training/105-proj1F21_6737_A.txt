My favorite person is smart. I feel slightly bad saying intelligence is one of the major deciding factors in who I look up to, seeing as intelligence isn't really a character quality, but I think it still factors into my choosing of a favorite person, for good or for ill. Because I would really like to be effective at the things I do, and so I do tend to look up to those who are similarly competent. Even if you always want to do the right thing, you kind of have to pay attention to actually doing a good job of it, and in today's day and age that often means sitting down and having a quality think about it first. The ability to make clever jokes is also a plus.
