One of my favorite characters of all time is Zuko from the 2005 animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender. To set the scene of why he is my favorite character, we need to go on a deeper dive to the lore of the show. In the show, some people are born to control the power of an element(air, water, fire, earth), with only one person, the Avatar, able to control all four. The position of the Avatar is important since he is a physical representation of the balance among elements. Each generation, a new Avatar is born in one of the four element nations, with this generation's Avatar, Aang, being born in the Air Nomad nation. The setup for the story is that Aang, afraid of his responsibilities as the Avatar, decides to run away and disappears in a freak storm. At the same time, the fire nation, knowing that the Avatar, who can stop their plans at world domination, launches a genocidal war against the Air Nomads, wiping them out. However, they are unable to find the Avatar and instead decide to continue their crusade against other nations.
 
Zuko is a prince, a firstborn son, of the Fire Nation. The Fire Nation followed a strong hierarchical and traditional structure, in which rules must be strictly followed. Prince Zuko, as a young man, was banished and scarred by this father, the Fire Lord Ozai, for speaking out of turn during a meeting, then further refusing to take up an Agni Kai, a duel, with his father. He sets out to gain redemption and regain his honor by spending the next couple of years attempting to find, and kill, the Avatar, who the Fire Nation still fears due to his tremendous power.
 
I think the biggest reason why he is my favorite character is the struggles that Zuko has to face. He is first introduced as a bad guy--the one pursuing and attempting to kill or imprison the main character of the show and his friends. But as his backstory is fleshed out throughout the show, he becomes more and more relatable. As a teen, it wasn't hard to relate with his issues. Deep down, he is someone who wants to do right, but circumstances always seem to be stacked against him.  His family, mostly his father and sister, are narcissistic and war-mongering, and disdain him for both his soft heart and inferior fire bending skills. And him, as a teen, merely wished to find his place in the world--something that I'm sure most teens can relate to.
 
But, as the show progresses, he learns and matures as a person, learning that his place and self-worth is his own to decide. To help him is his uncle Iroh, who is also one of the best characters in animated show history. Uncle Iroh acts as a guide, pushing Zuko in the right direction while at the same time allowing Zuko to face his trials and come to his own realizations by himself. Through Iroh, Zuko learns familial love and is able to break himself away from his father's overbearing presence in his mind.
 
Perhaps the greatest aspect of the character is that he needs to learn the hard truths in person. A lot of shows tend to have unrealistic or borderline non-existent reasons for a change of character. Zuko, on the other hand, must learn in person every mistake he has made. He places trust on his father and sister; this trust is misplaced and he his betrayed and made a fugitive after failing to capture the Avatar. He believes in the love his father gives him after he apparently kills the Avatar; only to learn that it was an elaborate plot by his sister for him to take the fall when the Avatar inevitably ends up still alive. Throughout his journey, he is faced with tribulations that he must take head on--and it is these tribulations that shape and mould him into the awesome character that he is.
