This band became the Beatles in August 1960, and Paul took on the role of bassist in 1961 after the current bassist at the time quit. This was not Paul's preferred instrument, and I admire the fact that he stepped into a role that needed to be filled, especially since it is one that tends to be less of a focus in terms of a band's popular appeal. In 1962, Richard Starkey (also known as Ringo Starr) replaced their drummer, and the famous Beatles' lineup was officially formed. The band would begin to stir up quite a hysteria amongst fans in the UK in 1963, and in the US in 1964, and continued to be one of the most influential and prolific bands for the entire rest of the decade - up until their breakup in 1969.
