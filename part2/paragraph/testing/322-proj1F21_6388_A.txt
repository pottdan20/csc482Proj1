Darrow au Andromedus from the novels Red Rising is a character who fights for himself and the many others who live under a tyrannical ruler. Though he comes from the lowest class, he had the determination to surpass the many barriers in society to become a champion for the people oppressed in society. He overcame his desire for vengeance to fight for something larger than himself. He rallied the support from people of all casts and made them realize the bests in themselves and fight for a cause that was just. Darrow is a character who greatly inspires me and makes me understand some of the best qualities when it comes to being a leader.
