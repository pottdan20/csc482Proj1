Every day I am thankful that I have Lucas in my life. He brings light to the darkest of situations, and lifts up everyone around him. His mathematical brilliance has greatly aided me in my own studies, especially when it comes to counting problems which I find very challenging. Lucas aspires to be an entrepreneur, and hopes to develop software and an app for combinatorial sheep management, a space which nobody has thus far been brave enough to explore. I believe wholeheartedly that he will succeed in accomplishing his dreams, and I will do all that I can to support him on his journey.
