There area few reasons why Chloe is my favorite person. The first is that we have so many shared childhood experiences. We both understand how it feels to be first generation Americans, with both French and American cultural influences in our upbringings. We speak every day, regardless of the physical distance between us, and have been there for each other through all the highs and lows of our lives. We know each other's families well, and have traveled to many places together.
