I have heard some negative things about Santa as well though which should also be addressed in this very unbiased essay. For one, it seems like he gives the more expensive gifts to the children of already rich parents, and the less expensive gifts to poorer families. Also, some of the poorest people on the planet are never visited by Santa while they are the ones who could need some gifts the most, such as water, food, or even medicine. It can be argued that for the fairness of the world he should rather give gifts to those who need them more than those who might not need them. I have also heard rumors that his existence might indeed be a lie, that he is just a made-up person. However, I strongly disbelieve this but am still obliged to mention it. I have personally seen him in person many Christmases in the past, although it was a while since the last time we met.Â
