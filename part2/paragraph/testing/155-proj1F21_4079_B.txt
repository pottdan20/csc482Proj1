Skateboards also offer more maneuverability due to their compact form and thus making it easier to make sharp turns and go through tighter spaces. Also, electric skateboards are not inconspicuous. There is a distinct sound from the outboard motors that pedestrians on the roads can very audibly hear, reducing the risk of potential crashes and injuries. There are concerns regarding the safety associated with them when compared to bikes but in the hands of a capable rider, these skateboards are fully capable of maneuvering and braking even on the hilly terrains. In fact, they are more capable of doing so than bikes which usually still come with strap and rub brakes which take more time to come to a complete stop from the same initial speed and cover a larger distance while doing so.
