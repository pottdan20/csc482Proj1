The following weeks after I found Blow's community, I started listening to his talks at various conventions such as GDC and HandmadeCon. In them, Blow seemed to have an astonishing technical knowledge as well as a carefully curated design sense. He saw the problems with the basic tools of our industry, and believes with a non-cynical mind that they are solvable. Jon's method of learning is exceptionally simple, but it inspires me to learn in a whole new way. It goes like this: find a problem that you are curious about, then work towards a solution in the most basic way possible, learning what you need to along the way. This mentality is somewhat standard, but his insights on the details are remarkable. He taught me to simply start working at something, instead of waiting until you know that you have it right, and that spirit remains with me all the time. Thus, the second thing I am thankful to Jonathan Blow for is his lessons on the value of work.
