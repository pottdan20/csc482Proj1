As previously mentioned, one of the reasons that I find my LS 400 so interesting is that it has been in the family for such a long time. Many cars do not even last 10 years much less the nearly 27 years for which this car has been running. Perhaps one of the reasons why the LS 400 continues to run so well is related to the perception that Japanese cars tend to be more reliable than others on average. This perception can be partly attributed to the Toyota Production System which is implemented in Japan just a few years before the car would have been released. This system has two main concepts. The first is that they will make only what is needed, when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed. The second is that the system should be automated but maintain the human touch. Because the Toyota Production System contains both social and technical aspects, it changes the way that the car manufacturers function as a whole, down to the very way that workers approach building a car. This cohesive vision leads to products that are increasingly reliable.
