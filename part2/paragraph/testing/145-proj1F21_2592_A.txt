The first reason I admire Satoshi is because he is very intelligent. Not only was he able to create the code for the Bitcoin blockchain, but he was able to think through the game-theoretical aspects of human monetary greed and how this would help keep the network running through mining. He was able to tie together advanced revolutionary technology with society and social aspects of humans to create a network that could not be censored or shut down.
