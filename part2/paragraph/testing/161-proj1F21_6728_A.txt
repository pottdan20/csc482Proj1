Perhaps the greatest aspect of the character is that he needs to learn the hard truths in person. A lot of shows tend to have unrealistic or borderline non-existent reasons for a change of character. Zuko, on the other hand, must learn in person every mistake he has made. He places trust on his father and sister; this trust is misplaced and he his betrayed and made a fugitive after failing to capture the Avatar. He believes in the love his father gives him after he apparently kills the Avatar; only to learn that it was an elaborate plot by his sister for him to take the fall when the Avatar inevitably ends up still alive. Throughout his journey, he is faced with tribulations that he must take head on--and it is these tribulations that shape and mould him into the awesome character that he is.
