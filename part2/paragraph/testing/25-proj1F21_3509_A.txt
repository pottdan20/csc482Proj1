One of my favorite people is Sam Seaborn from the TV show The West Wing. Sam is a lawyer working as Deputy Communications Director in the White House under Democratic President Josiah Bartlett. Throughout the show, he remains a faithful advisor and useful aid to the president while remaining steadfast in his beliefs. While I personally share more in common with Toby Ziegler, Sam is more of the person I wish to be.
