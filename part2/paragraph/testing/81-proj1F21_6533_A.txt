Lucas' personality is rounded off by his unparalleled sense of humor. Though his comedic repertoire is rather limited, the quality and timing of his content is impeccable.Â  Lucas has exactly three jokes which he tells, of which I have so far only heard the first one. It is impossible for me to encapsulate the innately hilarious core of this joke, though I can say that it has to do with spontaneous and unexpected harmonic systems. Lucas effectively uses humor to relieve the tension which naturally arises in such a rigorous environment. He also always laughs at my jokes, even when nobody else does, which makes me feel a lot better about myself.
