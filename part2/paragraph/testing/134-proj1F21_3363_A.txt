As a father, he has taught me how to take responsibility for my actions and how to be independent. Growing up, my father was very lenient with my brother and I when it came to hanging out with friends after school or on weekends. However, his policy was that whatever trouble we got into, we would have to suffer the repercussions and he would not attempt to bail us out of said trouble. Since he also worked long and late hours, my brother and I were in charge of making dinner for ourselves as well as handling all house chores. He taught us and gave me the skills necessary to be successful in the future.
