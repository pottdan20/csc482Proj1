The first owner was my grandfather who purchased the car in 1992, the same year my older sister was born. My grandfather absolutely loved the car and took great care of it. Growing up, he would taxi us from school to all our extra-curricular activities. What it did not have in speed or luxury, it had in panache. One seemingly normal day, my grandfather was driving us home, Â and he accidentally stalled the car on a steep hill. As the car rolled down the hill backwards, it seemed that he forgot what a brake was. It took 10 seconds to start the car again and for him to get the car to stop. That was the last time I remember my grandfather driving that car.
