My favorite thing about the car is its built-in features. Since all new cars in the state of California are mandated to have a blind spot monitor, this has made driving, particularly in moderate to severe traffic, much more enjoyable. This means that I no longer have to do the whole dance of looking back at my blind spot while driving on the freeway, which is considered a somewhat dangerous task, especially at high speeds. The other thing that is nice about the car is the fact that it comes with automatic lane keeping and vehicle distance systems, which makes it overall a much safer driving experience.
