We decided to sell the piece of junk for five hundred bucks before I went off to college. I ended up getting a new car that was much better than Blanca. Because of my experiences with Blanca, I'm way more appreciative of all the things my new car can do. It doesn't make any noise, and I know exactly how much gas I have at all times. Blanca reminded me of a sibling heirloom. It was passed from one sibling to the next, but only I was the one to experience all of its problems. Nevertheless, Blanca did her job and is definitely an unforgettable car.
