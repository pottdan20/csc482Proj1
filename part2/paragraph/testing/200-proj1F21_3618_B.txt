Most other dirt-bikes make their power in the bottom end, but this one due to the inspiration from the higher end it makes most of its power on the top end rather than the lower end. Its better for higher speed as it handles a lot more smoothly. From the factory this bike fits the bill of being a all-rounder as it can perform as it can work well as a dirt-bike and also as a road bike. This occurs due to fact that its very approachable as the suspension is optimized and the tires are a bit of an in-between between knobby road vs off-road ones.
