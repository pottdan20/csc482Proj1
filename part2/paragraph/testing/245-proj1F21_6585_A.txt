There are several myths that surround Tchaikovsky's life and actions. The biggest myth is most likely the idea that he was mentally ill, to the point that he was afraid his head would fall off when he was composing. This myth was promptly dispelled when it was noted that this myth was rooted in homophobia, given Tchaikovsky was gay.
