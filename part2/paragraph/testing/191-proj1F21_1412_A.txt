The final thing that I have learned from Blow is the most important. In his pursuit of making games, Blow has a fundamental drive to express something meaningful in his games. The way he talks about games makes them seem less like the complementary media that they currently are (combining story with some interaction) and more like a truly new form of art. Blow's games capture something indescribable about life, and through playing them, I have learned many things about the universe that are intimately close to my being, and that could never have been taught through any other medium. In this way, Jonathan Blow is a visionary, and makes me want nothing less to see that sort of vision in my own life. He inspires me to never relent in chasing that dream, and to believe in my own ability to express it.
