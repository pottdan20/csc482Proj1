Hawking remains one of my favorite historical figures, and overall favorite people, due to his resilience, his sense of humor, and his work in his field. These aspects of his life serve as a sort of inspiration for me. I feel that I can learn from the way that such a man lived his life and strive to model it albeit at a much smaller scale.
