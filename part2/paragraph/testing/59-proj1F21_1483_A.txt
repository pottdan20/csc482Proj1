Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't discuss Lynch's non feature films in this essay. One of his shorts just involves him making quinoa while narrating peculiar vignettes, and is aptly titled "David Lynch Cooks Quinoa." No, Lynch isn't afraid of quirkish forays into his personal life. Another short, "Six Figures Getting Sick," is an avant garde piece that I will concede might not be for everyone, but still has superb visuals, along with a literally blaring soundtrack. Lynch also created Twin Peaks, a 3 season series combining elements of horror, mystery, and the supernatural, while paying homage to the Neo-noir tradition. Twin Peaks has some of the most nerve-wracking scenes I've scene in any show, overlaid with amazing dialogue. Naturally, the series is no stranger to dappling with philosophy. Twin Peaks' "This is the water" scene is better, and I would argue more inspirational to those with good taste, than David Foster Wallace's extremely well regarded "This is Water" speech.
