My favorite vehicle is my WonderMobile! It's been in the family ever since I first started driving for my driver's permit. The first time I ever got behind the wheel was with my dad in an abandoned parking lot near the soccer fields. I remember struggling to park between the white lines; thankfully, driving has gotten easier since then.Â
