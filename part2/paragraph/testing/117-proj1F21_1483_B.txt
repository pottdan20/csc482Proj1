My earlier love of biking has faded over time, but the memories associated with it haven't. Deep down, I know the fading is temporary and caused by my current lack of involvement in the activity, and if I started cycling again I would definitely enjoy it. Unfortunately, getting into past hobbies is an endeavor I have historically failed at. Nevertheless, I consider myself blessed to have experienced the bliss that accompanied riding my bike.
