Ferry rides are typically also very smooth. The middle deck above the car deck has an area with booths for seating as well as snacks and an area for coffee. The middle deck is a great way to experience the rid if you aren't feeling up to the wind. There are typically large windows that offer riders the chance to take in the views. The seating makes for a great way to watch the views but still have a conversation with your fellow passenger without having to yell over the wind.
