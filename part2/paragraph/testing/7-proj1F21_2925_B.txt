When I turned seventeen, I got my driver's license, and the Camry became mine. By this time, my dad had bought a newer car for himself, but he saved the Camry for me to use. At this point, the Camry had seen a lot of wear and tear. The paint was peeling, there were watermarks on the windows, and the cloth seats were beginning to tear. Despite this, I loved it. I thought the wear and tear gave it character. One of my favorite features of the car was how the driver side rear view mirror was zip tied and glued onto the car. In addition to character, I loved how the wear and tear held stories. For example, there was a small coffee stain on one of the seats from when my friend and I got coffee before a robotics tournament. In fact, I have a lot of memories from my time driving the Camry. My robotics teammates and I would drive to tournaments in it, loudly blaring music and singing as we drove. My friends and I would go on late night cheesecake runs. We would pick up cheesecake from Safeway, drive up a hill, and sit in the car. While we were in the car, we would pass the time talking, looking at the stars, and eating. My sisters and I would drive to every hiking place we could find nearby.
