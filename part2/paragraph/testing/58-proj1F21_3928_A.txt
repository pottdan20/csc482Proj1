One of my favorite people is my best friend Kira. We met during WOW our freshman year and have only grown closer as the years passed by. Our first real hangout was hiking the P together. I had been wanting to go but none of my roommates liked hiking, and I ran into her doing laundry and convinced her to come with me. Her spontaneity and sense of adventure are one of my favorite qualities about her.
 
Kira and I share a lot of similar interests. She is studying Software Engineering (what a great profession) and enjoys the entrepreneurial side of engineering. We can talk for hours about nerdy CS stuff while the rest of our housemates don't understand our secret language of code. Oh and have I mentioned we're also housemates? We have been living together since sophomore year and have an amazing house off campus together!
 
This summer, Kira and I travelled to Europe together. We spent a week in England exploring London and the English countryside. Afterwards, we visited Ireland and finished off in Barcelona, Spain. She was the best travel buddy! We had very similar interests and wanted to see the same attractions, each the same food, and survived the same sketchy hostels together.
 
After our Europe travels, Kira and I went straight into WOW pre-week. We trained for five days straight and her sarcasm was the only thing keeping me going through those 7am meetings. We had 24 WOWies and they sorted the groups by first name, so we bonded over the difficulty of dealing with 5 Emmas. Although we had really different leadership styles, we complemented each other really well and made it through the week together. And best of all, our WOWies had a good time!
 
Sometime during the pandemic, Kira and I discovered that we have the complete opposite Myers Briggs personality types. I am an ESTJ while she is an INFP. But surprisingly we work really well together! She is the Steve Jobs to my Wozniak, and if we ever end up starting a company together you better watch out. Her creativity and innovation partnered with my problem solving and determination are a force to recon with...
