Although he is an amazing physical talent, what I admire most about George Kittle is his attitude, personality, and work ethic. He's the highest paid tight end in NFL history, but he works everyday like he's trying to make the team. He opts to wear a brace on his shoulder rather than have surgery to repair a minor injury because he doesn't want to have to miss workout days while he recovers. He interacts with fans and the media with joy and playfulness, often bringing the media in on inside jokes with teammates and the locker room. When he's mic'd up on the field you can hear him congratulating teammates and laughing maniacally after he makes a great block. Kittle's reach spreads beyond just football fans, as his infectious personality and affinity for professional wrestling led actor and former WWE star Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson to dub him "the People's Tight End", as a play on a popular WWE catch phrase. He's the ultimate football player, and the total package on and off the field. He encompasses what fans want to root for in player, and person we can all admire.Â
