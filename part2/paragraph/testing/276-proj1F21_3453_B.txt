The El Camino has a classic charm  that is nothing like the cars produced today. The coupe utility or utility car hybrid style hasn't been revisited for over three decades. Everything from the boxy front end to the manual roll down windows scream that it's from a different era. It takes three different keys to get into the car and get going: one for the door, one for the steering wheel lock, and a different one for the ignition. These features may seem outdated or annoying to some, but having grown up around them it only adds to the appeal for me. As modern cars continue to converge into similar hyper efficient and aero dynamic models with ultra modern features, the classic style and beauty of the El Camino stands out on its own.
