Imagine a person who is unselfish and only thinks about others. Who is willing to give people things of monetary value without expecting anything in return. Imagine that this person's one goal is to once a year give everyone around the world some joy in their life, while also working on improving the manners of kids. Wouldn't this person be considered the best person ever? Well, that person exists and his name is Santa Clause.
 
Once a year Santa travels the whole world and visits families everywhere just to give presents to those who have been good. So not only is he a very generous man who will donate, sometimes quite expensive, items to kids without expecting anything in return, but he will also only give these presents to the nice kids, creating an incentive for children all over the world to behave well all year round. So while making people happy with gifts, he also makes the world and the homes of many families a better place by keeping the kids in check. He also manages to travel around the whole world visiting up to millions of families in just one day which is incredible.
 
He also decides to live in an inhabitable place on earth, the north pole, which makes him both unbiased towards countries and also means he does not contribute to the housing shortage in the big cities around the planet. Instead, he lives in his mansion up north with his family, employing many factory workers to build all the gifts he gives away and also supplies them with housing, helping out the world economy with that aspect as well. He also employs and houses the caretakers of his flying reindeers. All in all, Santa is just a sweet man who is loved by everyone.
 
I have heard some negative things about Santa as well though which should also be addressed in this very unbiased essay. For one, it seems like he gives the more expensive gifts to the children of already rich parents, and the less expensive gifts to poorer families. Also, some of the poorest people on the planet are never visited by Santa while they are the ones who could need some gifts the most, such as water, food, or even medicine. It can be argued that for the fairness of the world he should rather give gifts to those who need them more than those who might not need them. I have also heard rumors that his existence might indeed be a lie, that he is just a made-up person. However, I strongly disbelieve this but am still obliged to mention it. I have personally seen him in person many Christmases in the past, although it was a while since the last time we met. 
 
Overall, Santa must the best person I have ever met, or even heard of for that matter. Giving away gifts of high monetary value to millions of children all around the world just to improve their manners of children, which must be the most unselfish thing anyone has ever done. And he is doing it each year! I think we all should take the time to say thank you to Santa when we see him next, he really deserves it!
