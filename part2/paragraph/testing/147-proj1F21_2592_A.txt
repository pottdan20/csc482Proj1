Satoshi Nakamoto may eventually go down as one of the most important people in recent history. Although he is anonymous (and may even be a she or a group of people) he has been able to give our generation a way to break free of the increasing wealth gap and centralization of power. He has not only given many people hope for a more fair system, but he has also created an entirely new branch of computer science research and development. Many young engineers now aspire to be blockchain developers, and I think the fact that he was able to inspire a whole generation of technologists is as admirable as it can get.
