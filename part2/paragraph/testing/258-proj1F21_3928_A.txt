Kira and I share a lot of similar interests. She is studying Software Engineering (what a great profession) and enjoys the entrepreneurial side of engineering. We can talk for hours about nerdy CS stuff while the rest of our housemates don't understand our secret language of code. Oh and have I mentioned we're also housemates? We have been living together since sophomore year and have an amazing house off campus together!
