A final reason that I admire my grandfather is that he has proven in his life to be a very ethical and overall good person. On a political level, his stance against the Vietnam War and his willingness to protest and almost get arrested trying to stop it seems like a brave and right-thinking thing to do in hindsight. Even now as an old man, my grandfather is still interested in helping society progress and keeping up with those changes. Further, more directly in his own life, my grandfather has proven his ethics. He and my grandmother never got legally married, but for my entire life, he’s always taken care of her and treated her with great kindness and respect. Even more impressive he’s taken my father and aunt and more recently me, my brother, and my cousin, into his heart and treated us just as if we were related by blood. When he had to my grandfather even got an office job, he did not particularly enjoy instead of acting in order to ensure there was enough money to raise my father and aunt. The kindness and empathy my grandfather shows to those around him every day are important reasons that he is one of the people I admire most.
