One of the characteristics I admire most about da Vinci was his insatiable hunger for knowledge. He never pushed his findings or views, implying fame or money was not as important to him. He learned simply for the sake of learning -- constantly observing, experimenting, inventing, and recording his ideas. Not only was he a jack of all trades, but he was also brilliant in each of them. I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology with other fields such as art and philosophy. Leonardo da Vinci seemed able to combine them and excel at them effortlessly. For that, I hold him in the highest regard.
