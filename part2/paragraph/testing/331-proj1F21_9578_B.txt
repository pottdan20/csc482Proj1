All in all the A10 Warthog is an aircraft built for a war that thankfully never occurred. If we ever do experience anything close to an armored invasion, the A10 certainly provides some peace of mind. Built around the GAU 8/A a powerful naval cannon, and the need for close air support, the A10 had some serious design challenges from the start. Developed in just under 7 years, this aircraft is a modern marvel and incorporates some incredible feats of engineering in a durable, reliable package.Â
