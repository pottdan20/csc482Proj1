Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is a Russian Composer who is responsible for a lot of my favorite works of romantic era classical music. Unfortunately, he struggled with depression and frequent personal tragedies. Despite these issues, he was able to produce some of the most inspirational and enjoyable music during the 1800s.
