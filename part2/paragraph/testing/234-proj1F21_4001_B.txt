Over the several years and many long miles, I’ve ridden my road bike, it has also accumulated a lot of sentimental value to me. I’ve raced a couple of triathlons on the bike, and it has never let me down. In addition, I have yet to crash on the Aeroad. My freshman year I crashed twice on two different bikes, but since I bought the Aeroad I have ridden thousands of miles over the past couple of years including some very sketch descent and criterium races, and have always ridden away unscathed. No doubt this is partially due to my own increasing skill, but I’m superstitious and cannot help but credit the bike as well. I also have so many memories on the bike, from feeling dog tired after climbing to the top of Figueroa Mountain to the satisfaction of descending into our campsite when I went bike-packing with my girlfriend and my friend Kevin in Big Sur. Though it may just be a vehicle my road bike has a special place in my heart.
