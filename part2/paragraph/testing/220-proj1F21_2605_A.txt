As high-schoolers, it was important that we prepare and plan early for our college applications. We often feel overwhelmed, as we didn’t know what we wanted to do after graduation from high school. Mr Who knew this too well and was experienced in guiding students into their own choices. He would ask senior students to share their experiences with us, provide us plenty of information about the timeline of college applications, majors, scholarship, etc.
