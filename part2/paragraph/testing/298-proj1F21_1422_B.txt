I like ferries because they're a lot larger than the traditional boat which reduces the amount of seasickness one experiences. This makes it possible to roam around on deck and watch the views. The best part of the experience is walking around on deck. From there, if it's a sunny day, its the perfect combination of warm sun and the wind from the water and the boat that keeps you warm but not too warm. The views are typically amazing. There are ferries in Washington State that transport people around the islands and offer stunning views of the mountains and the Seattle skyline especially at sunset.
