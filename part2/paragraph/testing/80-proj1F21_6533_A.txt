One of Lucas' greatest weaknesses stems from an early childhood tragedy. While out on a hike, Lucas' great aunt Mary-Beth Gertrude was lost to and presumably killed by a large group of rabid squirrels. The loss took a great toll on his mental health, and even put a pause to his sheep counting for over a year. An otherwise fearless character, Lucas is deathly afraid of squirrels because of the incident. Every time he sees a squirrel on campus, he sprints to the nearest building for cover. This presents a difficult challenge, given the frequency of squirrels on campus. Despite my repeatedly reminding him that squirrel related deaths are substantially less common in California than they are in North Dakota, the fear is too deeply ingrained in his behavior. Nevertheless, Lucas thrives in the math department here and doesn't let his squirrel phobia get in the way of his studies.
