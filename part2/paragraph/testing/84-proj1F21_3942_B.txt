My sister had this car for the entirety of her own college years. She was the one who gave it the nickname Blanca because that was the feminine Spanish word for white. She also liked the way it sounded. It was around her third year in college when my parents told me that I was going to get Blanca when my sister was done. At first, I was excited because it meant that I'd have a car to use during high school. What I didn't know was that after eight years of use, Blanca would be on her way out.
